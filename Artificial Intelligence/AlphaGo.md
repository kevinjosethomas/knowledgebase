AlphaGo was a model developed by DeepMind which achieved computational superiority in the game of Go, which was long considered one of the most challenging games for a computer to master.

AlphaGo has a policy and value head, which predicts potential moves and predicts the likelihood of winning respectively. It was trained with [[Reinforcement Learning (RL)]], playing millions of games against itself and learning from wins/losses. 

After AlphaGo, DeepMind developed [[AlphaZero]]
