Logistic regression is used to estimate the probability of an event occurring, based on a given dataset of independent variables. This <span class="highlight">logit model</span> is often used for classification and predictive analytics, and since this outcome is a probability, the dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1. Thus, in logistic regression, data is divided into regions using the sigmoid curve. Essentially, predictions fall into classes based on probability.
