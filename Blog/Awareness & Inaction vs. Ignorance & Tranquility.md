title: "Awareness & Inaction vs. Ignorance & Tranquility"
date: "2024-12-13"

Would you rather:
- Be aware of the *right* thing to do in every moment of your life, but often not be able to choose those right actions  
- Live in ignorance, and never be aware that you aren't leading an optimal lifestyle in the moment

Lately, I've repeatedly found myself in positions where I know what the objectively right thing to do is. Or to be more colloquial: positions where I know what a better version of me would do. Yet, despite being aware of the decision I *should* (is doing the right thing always truly the right thing to do?) make, I often struggle to actually make that choice. What hinders me?

I'm not sure: short-term gratification, resistance to change/improve, doubt, rotting brain wrinkles? Probably mostly the former (and also the rotting brain juices). It's quite a dilemma, and something I'm encountering too many times a day now. I think it's a step forwardâ€”that, even for tiny decisions I make, I'm often able to step out of the current moment and look at the consequences of what might happen (kinda like if [[Aligning Superhuman AI with Human Behavior - Chess as a Model System (McIlroy-Young et al. 2020)|Maia]] could do search instead of simply looking at a position and impulsively making a chess move!) based on the choices I make. But it's also quite painful. I spent months trying to condition myself to make the pain of inaction greater than the pain of action, and that isn't the best feeling when I feel like I'm in a constant state of inaction ðŸ˜°

Ironically, my brain tells me that the right move in this moment is to promise to start to always choose the right choice now onwards, but deep inside, I know the rotting brain juices will prevail. The *Brain*â€”what strange wonderful sustenance of life.
