title: "Awareness & Inaction vs. Ignorance & Tranquility"
date: "2024-12-13"

Would you rather:
- Be aware of the *right* thing to do in every moment of your life, but often not be able to choose those right actions  
- Live in ignorance, and never be aware that you aren't leading an optimal lifestyle in the moment

Recently, I often find myself in positions where I know what the objectively right thing to do is. Or to be more colloquial: positions where I know what a better version of me would do. Yet, despite being aware of the decision I should make, I often struggle to actually make that choice. What hinders me?

I'm not sure: short-term gratification, resistance to change/improve, doubt. Probably mostly the latter. It's honestly quite a dilemma, and something I'm encountering multiple times a day now. I think it's a step forwardâ€”that for almost every (even tiny) decision I make, I'm able to step out of the current moment and effectively look at the consequences of what might happen (kinda like if Maia could do search instead of simply looking at a position and making a chess move solely based on its memory!) based on the choices I make. But it's also painful. I spent a lot of time to condition myself to make the pain of inaction greater than the pain of action, and that isn't the best feeling when I feel like I'm in a constant state of inaction ðŸ˜°

Ironically, my brain tells me that the right move in this moment is to promise to start to always choose the right choice now onwards, atleast one step at a time. Let's see how that goes. The Brainâ€”what strange wonderful sustenance of life.
