AOs love to read and learn from the essays of such a creative, diverse, intelligent group of students. These essays are essentially the opening scene of a movie or the first page of a book ~ it sets the table for what to expect.

### General Knowledge
- No specific topic that is prevalent
- Essays should be reflective, and allow AOs to get to know the students
	- Not graded like in English class
	- Essays are not even primarily a way to judge writing ability
		- You should be thoughtful and sophisticated but thats not the point
- **The essay is an opportunity, not a hurdle**
	- It is a window to express yourself to AOs
- If you accurately convey who you are, it will fit with the rest of your application anyway
- Even the most ordinary topic can be enticing if it is authentically you
- **The essay is often not the most important part of the file**
	- They don't take away from candidacy, but they do contribute to it
	- Essays can also become the centrepiece of the application if they are really good
- Essay is not make-or-break, GPA is not make-or-break
	- There are great people who are not great readers

### Main Insights
- ***Show***, don't tell
	- It should not be a recounting of the fact
	- Vivid language; creates a sense of place; shows how you are reflecting on things
- Be reflective
	- ***Essay should be about you***
	- The goal is so for AOs to be able to see who you are
		- Essays are simply a means to an end to achieve this
	- Let your voice come through
		- AOs should be able to read the essay and then kinda know what it would be like to have a real conversation with you
		- If it is worked over and edited and edited, you might lose the voice
			- While you need it to be reviewed, make sure no one is rewriting
		- It should sound like you
			- Funny or liked? That should be your voice in the essay
			- Serious or solemn? That should be your voice in the essay
	- *"If we get to the end of an essay, and we know what it means for you, thats when your voice has come through"*
- Keep it simple
	- Its maximum of 650 words
		- not a place to show off a big vocabulary
		- not a place to write big sentences with semicolons and commas and everything
	- Your voice is hopefully
		- Sophisticated and thoughtful
		- But also natural and approachable
	- Someone who has never met you before should be able to read it and get a sense of who you are
- Unsuccessful essays are ones that sound like they weren't authentically written, or they dont match the application
	- Trust yourself and understand that you are the best person for the job

### Often Successful Tropes
- When a student writes about changing their mind about something, and now see things differently
	- Not just because they grew up and became mature
	- But more when they are generous towards their previous position
		- It shouldn't be "oh I was ignorant and I was a fool, and now I am enlightened and I see it this way"
		- it should be more like "things kinda made sense to me this way, and then this happened, and now I see it this way"
- Reflecting on a relationship
	- Make sure you don't write about others but write about you
		- Don't forget to reflect, and bring back why it is important to you
		- Bring it back to you, and how specifically how that relationship has affected you
	- Relationship essays are valuable, they go in two directions:
		- You and the person
		- How you interact with the person
	- College is residential, you make relationships with other people
- Passion
	- How a passion animates you and gets you excited
	- Allows AOs to see how a student is excited about a certain topic
	- Make sure you reflect on what it is that makes you excited, and show that excitement
- Conveying a great sense of place
	- How a place or where someone comes from has influenced/affected them
		- "Think about a place that is important to you, and why"
	- Reflect on how you have grown up, where you come from, etc
- Talks about an experience that humbled them and made them feel vulnerable
	- Instead of "I experienced failure, and then I turned it around and became widely successful"
		- But rather, being able to sit in the experience of being wrong about something, or hurting someones feelings, having real regret about something
		- Doesn't have to be a miserable picture, or be wallowing in self-pity
	- To err is human
		- We all have experiences where we are not at our best
	- Showing vulnerability and highlighting an experience where you weren't at your best can show a new dimension of your humanity
	- Its people who read and discuss your applications
		- You can strike chords and be relatable
- When you have mentors and friends read you essay,
	- instead of asking "is this good", ask "does this sound like me?"
