### The Demand Curve
- A demand curve is a graphical representation of a demand schedule
- The demand curve is downward sloping showing the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded
- When reading a demand curve, assume all outside factors, such as income, are held constant. This is called ceteris paribus.
