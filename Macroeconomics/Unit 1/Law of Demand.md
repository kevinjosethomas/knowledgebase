## What is demand?
Demand is the different quantities of goods that consumers are willing and able to buy at different prices.
### What is the Law of Demand
The law of demand states that there is an **INVERSE*** relationship between price and quantity demanded, not just quantity.
### Why does the Law of Demand occur?
The law of demand is the result of three separate behaviour patterns that overlap:
1. The Substitution effect
2. The Income effect
3. The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility
### The Substitution Effect
The price goes up for one product. Consumers typically buy less of that product and more of another substitute product.
- Examples: Coke vs Pepsi; McDonalds vs Wendy's
### The Income Effect
If the price goes down for a product, the purchasing power increases for consumersâ€“allowing them to purchase more.
### The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility
- Utility = Satisfaction
- We buy goods because we get utility from them
- The **law of diminishing marginal utility*** states that as you consume more units of any good, the additional satisfaction from each additional unit will eventually start to decrease
- In other words, the more you buy any good the less satisfaction you get from each new unit
### Shifts in Demand
##### Changes in Demand
- Ceteris paribus: "all other things held constant"
- When the ceteris paribus assumption is dropped, movement no longer occurs along the demand curve. Rather, the entire demand curve shifts.
- A shift means that at the same prices, more people are willing and able to purchase that good
- **There is a change in demand, not a change in quantity demanded**
- **Changes in price DO NOT shift the curve**
