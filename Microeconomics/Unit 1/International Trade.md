## Why do people trade?
1. Assume people didn't trade. What things would you have to go without?
	1. Everything you don't produce yourself! Clothes, car, cell phone, bananas, etc
	2. **Everyone specializes in the production of goods and services and trades it to others**
2. What would life be like if cities couldn't trade with cities or states couldn't trade with states?
	1. Limiting trade would reduce people's choices and make people worse off
	2. **More access to trade means more choices and a higher standard of living**
