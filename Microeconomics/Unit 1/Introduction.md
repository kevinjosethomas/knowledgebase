Scarcity is the economizing problem. Society has unlimited wants but limited resources – so how do you determine what to produce? 
- How do we feed everybody?
- How do we educate everybody?
## Terminology
- **Theoretical Economics:** Economists use the scientific method to make generalized and abstractions to develop theories
- **Policy Economics:** These theories are then applied to the problem or meet economic goals
- **Positive:** Factual statements. Ex: The price of gas is rising, and gas prices are expected to fall in the future
- **Normative:** Opinion-based statements. Ex: The price of gas is too high
- **Tradeoff:** All decisions involve a trade-off
	- Trade-offs are all the alternatives that we give up whenever we choose one course of action over others
- **Opportunity Cost:** Quantifying the trade-off of sacrificing the second-best option when picking the best option
- **Constant Opportunity Cost:** Resources are easily adaptable for producing either good. For ex: sacrificing one pizza gives you one pasta, or vice versa. The result is a straight-line PPC (not common)
- **Utility:** Satisfaction
- **Marginal:** Additional
- **Allocate:** Distribute
- **Investment:** The money businesses spend to improve their production: \$1,000 new computer, $1,000,000 new factory, etc. Don't confuse investments with stocks, bonds, mutual funds, company shares, etc
- **Goods:** Physical/tangible objects that satisfy needs and wants
	- **Consumer Goods:** created for direct consumption (pizza, sneakers, jeans, etc)
	- **Capital Goods:** created for indirect consumption; business purchases to help produce goods (oven, blenders, knives, etc) 
	- Basically goods that are used to make consumer goods
- **Services:** actions or activities that one person performs for another (teaching, cleaning, cooking, etc)
- **Price:** is the amount that the consumer pays
- **Cost:** is the amount that the seller pays to produce a good
- **Scarcity:** occurs at all times for all goods
- **Shortages:** occur when producers will not or cannot offer goods or services at current prices. Shortages are temporary. Demand > Supply
- **Accountants:** Look only at explicit costs. Explicit costs are traditional "out of pocket costs" of decision making
	- Ex: Going to Disneyland: plane ticket, hotel, transfer to hotel, tickets for disneyland, food, etc
- **Economists:** Look at the explicit and implicit costs. Implicit costs are the opportunity costs such as forgone time and forgone income
	- Ex: if Sidney Crosby leaves the NHL to open a coffee shop: cost of business, lost wages from NHL
- **Law of Increasing Opportunity Cost:** As you produce more of any good, the opportunity cost (forgone production of another good) will increase
	- This is because resources are NOT easily adaptable to producing both goods. For example, some people might be really good at cooking and some really good at coding. Playing at maximum efficiency, moving people from making pizza to making robots will have minimal opportunity cost because we keep the cooks in the kitchen and move the programmers to the office. However, if we keep trying to maximize robots, we will end up with increasing opportunity costs as we move cooks to the office (low efficiency).
## The 5 Main Assumptions of Economics
- Society's wants are unlimited, but ALL resources are limited
- Due to scarcity, choices must be made. Every choice has a cost (trade-off)
- Everyone's goal is to make choices that maximize their satisfaction
- Everyone acts rationally by comparing the marginal costs and marginal benefits of every choice
- Real-life situations can be explained and analyzed through simplified models and graphs

## The 4 Factors of Production
- Producing goods and services requires the use of resources
- All resources can be classified as one of the following four **Factors of Production**:
	- **Land:** All natural resources that are used to produce goods and services. Anything that comes from nature: water, sun, plants, oil, trees, stone, animals, etc
	- **Labour:** Any effort a person devotes to a task for which that person is paid (manual labourers, lawyers, doctors, teachers, waiters, etc)
	- **Capital:** Any skills or knowledge gained by a worker through education and experience.
		- **Physical Capital:** tools, machinery, computers, etc
		- **Human Capital:** college degrees, vocational training, etc
	- **Entrepreneurship:** Ambitious leaders that combine the other factors of production to create goods and services
		- Entrepreneurs take the initiative, innovate, and act as the risk bearers; so they can obtain profit
## Using Economic Models:
- Step 1: Explain concepts in words
- Step 2: Use numbers as examples
- Step 3: Generate graphs from numbers
- Step 4: Make generalizations using graphs
## Efficiency
The PPC illustrates efficiency.
- An economy is efficient if there is no way to make anyone better off without making at least one person worse off
- An economy can be *efficient in production*
- An economy can be *efficient in the allocation*

**Productive Efficiency:**
- Products are being produced in the least costly way
- This is represented by any point on the PPC

**Allocative Efficiency:**
- The products being produced are the ones most desired by society – the consumers are as well off as possible
- The **optimal point*** on the PPC depends on the desire of society. It is a combination of productive efficiency and allocative efficiency.

## Production Possibilities
- Economic growth is a sustained rise in output
	- It is shown as an outward shift in of the PPC

## 3 Shifters of the PPC
- Change in resource quantity or quality
- Change in technology
- Change in trade

## Governments
- The government must step in to help ***allocate*** (distribute) resources. The question is how much government involvement.
- When there is not enough to go around, what are the different ways to decide who gets the limited resource?

Every society must answer three economic questions:
- What goods and services should be produced?
- How should these goods and services be produced?
- Who consumes these goods and services?
The way these questions are answered determines the **economic system**. An economic system is the method used by a society to produce and distribute goods and services.
## Economic Systems
- Centrally-Planned (Command) Economy
- Free Market Economy
- Mixed Economy

## Centrally-Planned Economy (Communism)
- The government owns all the resources
- They decide what to produce, how much to produce, and who will receive it
- However, centrally planned economies face problems of poor-quality goods, shortages, and unhappy citizens?
- No profit means there is no incentive to work harder
- With government owning the resources, and with government deciding which goods and services to produce, and how much to produce, change is slow if it happens at all

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Communism
##### Pros
- Low unemployment – everyone has a job
- Great job security – the government doesn't go out of business
- Equal incomes means no extremely poor people
##### Cons
- No incentive to work harder
- No incentive to innovate or come up with good ideas
- No competition keeps the quality of goods poor
- Potential corruption of leaders
- Fewer individual freedoms, more restrictions on the population

### Characteristics of a Free Market
- Little government involvement in the economy (Laissez Faire = Let it be)
- Individuals own resources and answer the three economic questions
- The opportunity to make a profit gives people an incentive to produce quality items efficiently
- Wide variety of goods available to consumers
- Competition and self-interest work together to regulate the economy (keep prices down and quality up). The "invisible hand"

### Communism vs. Free Market
Free markets regulate themselves because other business have an incentive to compete and earn profit. More competition lowers prices and provides better quality products with more product variety. We produce the goods and services that society wants because "resources follow profits"

However, in communism, other businesses cannot compete and there is no competition. Thus, there is often higher prices, lower quality, and less product variety. More products will not be made until the government creates a new factory. The end result: there is a shortage of goods that consumers want, produced at the highest prices and the lower quality.

### The Invisible Hand
The concept that society's goals will be met as individuals seek their own self-interest
- Profit-seeking producers will make more
- Competition between firms will result in low prices, high quality, and greater efficiency.
- The government doesn't need to get involved since the needs of society are automatically met.
- Competition and self-interest act as an **invisible hand** that regulates the free market

### Attacks Against Capitalism
- Companies are greedy and do anything to screw over consumers
- Companies have an incentive to satisfy the needs of consumers. If they don't, they will go out of business
- Capitalism causes companies to outsource US jobs overseas. America suffers because companies want more profit!
- Capitalism only helps the rich. US companies enslave and exploit third-world workers in sweatshops
	- Sweatshop workers are not forced labour, they make the decision to work there voluntarily. Why?
	- Although the working conditions are far below US standards, working in a sweatshop is better than the alternative
	- Sweatshop wages in third-world countries are more than double their country's average wages

**Who is to blame for these people being so poor?** Low productivity. If a country doesn't produce very much, it can't afford to pay it's workers much.

**Why do these countries have such low productivity?** Corrupt governments, inadequate physical capital and infrastructure, and undeveloped human capital

## The Circular Flow Model
#### The Product Market
- The place where goods and services produced by businesses are sold to households
- Businesses sell goods and services to individuals through the product market
#### The Resource (Factor) Market
- The place where resources (land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship) are sold to businesses
- In capitalism, individuals own the resources: labour, land, capital, and entrepreneurship
- Individuals provide resources for business through the resource market.
## Absolute and Comparative Advantage
- **Absolute advantage:** Producer that can produce the most output OR requires the least amount of inputs/resources
- **Comparative Advantage:** Producer with the lowest opportunity cost

Companies and countries should specialize in producing the goods that are cheaper for them to produce.
$$\text{Per unit opportunity cost} = \frac{\text{opp cost}}{\text{units gained}}$$
