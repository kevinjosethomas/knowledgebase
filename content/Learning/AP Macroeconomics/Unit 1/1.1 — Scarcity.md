Scarcity is the fundamental economic problem: **limited resources** but **unlimited wants**. It forces individuals, businesses, and governments to make choices about how to allocate resources.
### Key Concepts
1. **Limited Resources**  
   - **Land:** Natural resources (e.g., water, minerals).  
   - **Labor:** Human effort in production.  
   - **Capital:** Tools, machinery, and skills.  
   - **Entrepreneurship:** Combining resources to create goods/services.
2. **Unlimited Wants**
   - Human desires are endless, creating a gap between wants and resources.
3. **Trade-offs and Opportunity Cost**  
   - Every choice involves giving up the next-best alternative.  
   - Opportunity cost is the value of what is foregone.
4. **Three Economic Questions**  
   - What to produce?*
   - ow to produce?
   - or whom to produce?

### Scarcity in Economic Systems
- **Market Economy:** Decisions made by prices and competition.  
- **Command Economy:** The government allocates resources.  
- **Mixed Economy:** Combines market and government decisions.
