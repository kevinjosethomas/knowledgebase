1. **Law of Supply**  
   - There is a **direct relationship** between price and quantity supplied.  
   - As price increases, quantity supplied increases; as price decreases, quantity supplied decreases.
2. **Determinants of Supply**  
   Factors that shift the supply curve:  
   - **Input Prices:** Higher costs reduce supply.  
   - **Technology:** Better technology increases supply.  
   - **Number of Sellers:** More sellers increase supply.  
   - **Government Action:** Taxes reduce supply, subsidies increase it.  
   - **Expectations:** Future price changes affect current supply.
3. **Movement vs. Shift**  
   - **Movement along the curve:** Caused by a change in the price of the good.  
   - **Shift of the curve:** Caused by a change in any determinant of supply.

The supply curve is upward-sloping, showing the positive relationship between price and quantity supplied.
