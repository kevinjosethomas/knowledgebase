The market is depicted through an intersection of the [[1.5 — Supply|supply]] and [[1.4 — Demand|demand]] curves. This intersection represents a market equilibrium, and it's where the **quantity demanded** equals the **quantity supplied**, determining the equilibrium price and quantity.

1. **Equilibrium**  
   - The point where the demand and supply curves intersect.  
   - At this price, the market clears with no shortages or surpluses.
2. **Disequilibrium**  
   - **Surplus:** When quantity supplied > quantity demanded (price is too high).  
   - **Shortage:** When quantity demanded > quantity supplied (price is too low).  
3. **Changes in Equilibrium**  
   - **Shifts in Demand or Supply:**  
     - An increase in demand shifts the curve right, raising both price and quantity.  
     - An increase in supply shifts the curve right, lowering price and increasing quantity.  
   - **Simultaneous Shifts:** If both curves shift, the impact on price and quantity depends on the magnitude of each shift.
4. **Price Controls**  
   - **Price Ceiling:** A maximum price below equilibrium, causing shortages.  
   - **Price Floor:** A minimum price above equilibrium, causing surpluses.
