#### Circular Flow Model
The circular flow model shows how money, resources, and goods/services move between households and businesses in the economy:
1. **Households** provide resources (labor) to businesses in exchange for income.  
2. **Businesses** use resources to produce goods/services and sell them to households.  
3. **Government** interacts by collecting taxes and redistributing income through public services.

#### Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
GDP is the **dollar value** of all **final goods** and services produced within a country's borders in a year.
- **Dollar Value:** GDP is measured in dollars.  
- **Final Goods:** Does not include intermediate goods (goods used in production of final goods).  
- **One Year:** Measures annual economic performance.

#### Why is GDP Important?
GDP measures how well a country is doing financially. It helps us:  
1. Compare to previous years (**growth**).  
2. Evaluate policy changes (**effectiveness**).  
3. Compare to other countries (**relative performance**).

#### Measuring Growth
The year-to-year change in GDP is calculated as:  
$$
\text{Change in GDP} = \frac{\text{Year 2 - Year 1}}{\text{Year 1}}
$$

#### Calculating GDP
Two methods of calculating GDP:
1. **Expenditures Approach:** Add all spending on final goods/services.  
2. **Income Approach:** Add all income from selling final goods/services.  
   - Both methods yield the same value, as every dollar spent is income to someone else.

#### Components of the Expenditures Approach
1. **Consumer Spending (C):** Spending on goods and services.  
   - Example: \$5 pizza.  
2. **Investment (I):** Spending by businesses on tools/machinery.  
   - Example: Buying new equipment.  
3. **Government Spending (G):** Spending on goods/services (not transfer payments like Social Security).  
   - Example: Military spending.  
4. **Net Exports ($X_n$):** Exports (X) - Imports (M).  
   - Example: Value of 3 Ford cars minus 2 Honda imports.

$$
GDP = C + I + G + X_n
