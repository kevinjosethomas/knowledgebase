#### Not Included in GDP
1. **Intermediate Goods:** Avoids double counting.
   - Example: Price of a car, not its parts.  
2. **Non-Production Transactions:**  
   - **Financial Transactions:** Stocks, bonds, real estate.  
   - **Used Goods:** Old cars, thrifted clothes.  
3. **Non-Market/Illegal Activities:**  
   - Example: Illegal drugs, unpaid work.

#### Problems with GDP
- **Inflation:** Rising prices can make GDP look larger even without increased production.  
   - Example: Year 1: 10 apples at \$1 = \$10; Year 2: 10 apples at \$1.25 = \$12.50.  
- **Population Differences:** Larger GDP doesn't mean a higher standard of living unless adjusted for population size.

#### Real vs. Nominal GDP
- **Nominal GDP:** Measured in current prices, unadjusted for inflation.  
- **Real GDP:** Adjusted for inflation, expressed in constant dollars.

This is further described in [[2.6 — Real vs. Nominal GDP]].
#### Real GDP Per Capita
Real GDP per capita measures the average production per person:  
$$
\text{Real GDP per Capita} = \frac{\text{Real GDP}}{\text{Population}}
$$
It is the best indicator of a nation’s standard of living.
