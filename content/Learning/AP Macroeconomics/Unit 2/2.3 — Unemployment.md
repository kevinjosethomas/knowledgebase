The unemployment rate measures the percentage of people in the **labour force** who want a job but are not working.
$$
\text{Unemployment Rate} = \frac{\text{\# Unemployed}}{\text{\# in Labor Force}} \times 100
$$

#### Who Is in the Labor Force?
To be counted in the labor force, an individual must:
- Be **above 16 years old**.  
- Be **able and willing to work**.  
- Not be **institutionalized** (e.g., in jail or long-term care).  
- Not be in the **military**, **full-time education**, or **retired**.
#### Types of Unemployment
1. **Frictional Unemployment:**  
   - Temporary unemployment or being between jobs.  
   - Example: A college graduate looking for their first job.  
2. **Structural Unemployment:**  
   - Occurs when workers' skills become obsolete or no longer meet market demands.  
   - Example: Automation replacing factory jobs.  
   - Includes **technological unemployment** (caused by advancements in technology).
3. **Cyclical Unemployment:**  
   - Unemployment caused by a downturn in the business cycle (recession).  
   - Example: Layoffs during an economic contraction.  
4. **Seasonal Unemployment:**  
   - Occurs due to the time of year or nature of a job.  
   - Example: Holiday retail workers or agricultural jobs.
#### Natural Rate of Unemployment (NRU)
The Natural Rate of Unemployment is the sum of frictional and structural unemployment, representing the "normal" level of unemployment in a healthy economy. Full Employment is when the economy is at NRU, cyclical unemployment is zero.  
#### Labor Force Participation Rate
The percentage of the working-age population in the labor force:
$$
\text{Labor Force Participation Rate} = \frac{\text{\# in Labor Force}}{\text{\# of Working-Age Population}} \times 100
$$

#### Hidden Problems with Unemployment Rate
1. **Discouraged Workers:**  
   - People who stop looking for work are no longer counted as unemployed, which can understate the unemployment rate.
2. **Underemployment:**  
   - Workers employed part-time or below their skill level are considered employed, which can overstate economic health.
3. **Inequality:**  
   - The unemployment rate does not show disparities by age, race, or region.

Unemployment is essential to long run equilibrium in the economy and is heavily discussed in Unit 3 ([[3.3 — Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS)]], [[3.4 — Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS)]], [[3.5 — Equilibrium in Aggregate Supply and Demand]], [[3.9 — Automatic Stabilizers]])
