Inflation is the rising general level of prices over time, which reduces the purchasing power of money. It is a key economic indicator that affects consumers, businesses, and governments. Inflation has its side effects and consequences, which are further described in [[2.5 â€” Costs of Inflation]].
#### Price Indices
Price indices measure average price changes for a group of goods and services over time. The most commonly used price indices is the Consumer Price Index, which measures the average change in prices of a "market basket" of goods and services consumed by households.  

It is calculated by:
   $$
   \text{CPI} = \frac{\text{Cost of Market Basket in Current Year}}{\text{Cost of Market Basket in Base Year}} \times 100
   $$

For example, a CPI of 120 means prices are 20% higher than the base year.  

#### Inflation Rate
The inflation rate is the percentage change in the price level from one period to the next.  
$$
\text{Inflation Rate} = \frac{\text{CPI}_{\text{new}} - \text{CPI}_{\text{old}}}{\text{CPI}_{\text{old}}} \times 100
$$

Due to inflation, we use both nominal and real values while evaluating the economy and price level:

1. **Nominal Values:**  
   - Measured in current prices.  
   - Example: Nominal wages.
2. **Real Values:**  
   - Adjusted for inflation to reflect purchasing power.  
   - Formula for real values:$$
   \text{Real Value} = \frac{\text{Nominal Value}}{\text{CPI}} \times 100
   $$
#### GDP Deflator
The GDP deflator measures inflation across all goods/services in the economy. Unlike CPI, it includes changes in consumption patterns.  
$$
\text{GDP Deflator} = \frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{Real GDP}} \times 100
$$
