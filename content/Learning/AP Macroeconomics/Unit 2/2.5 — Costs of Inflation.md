Inflation reduces the purchasing power of money, creating economic inefficiencies and redistributing wealth. While moderate inflation is normal in a growing economy, high or unexpected inflation can have significant negative effects. There are few specific types of [[2.4 â€” Price Indices and Inflation|inflation]]:
#### Types of Costs
1. **Shoe-Leather Costs:**  
   - Increased effort to avoid holding cash as inflation erodes its value.  
   - Example: Frequent trips to the bank to minimize idle cash.
2. **Menu Costs:**  
   - The cost of updating prices on menus, labels, or systems due to changing prices.  
   - Example: Restaurants constantly reprinting menus.
3. **Unit of Account Costs:**  
   - Money loses its reliability as a measure of value, making it harder to plan or compare prices over time.  
   - Example: Businesses struggle to budget due to price instability.

#### Winners and Losers of Inflation
1. **Winners:**  
   - **Borrowers:** Loans are repaid with money worth less than when borrowed.  
   - **Asset Holders:** Rising prices increase the value of real assets (e.g., property, stocks).
2. **Losers:**  
   - **Savers:** Savings lose purchasing power unless interest rates match or exceed inflation.  
   - **Fixed-Income Earners:** Retirees and others on fixed incomes lose purchasing power.  
   - **Lenders:** Loans are repaid with devalued money.

#### Effects of Unexpected Inflation
Unexpected inflation causes wealth redistribution and disrupts economic stability:
- **Contracts:** Long-term agreements (e.g., wages, rents) may not account for price changes, leading to unfair outcomes.  
- **Uncertainty:** Businesses and consumers hesitate to make decisions, slowing economic growth.  
- **Inequality:** Inflation can disproportionately hurt low-income households that spend more on necessities.

#### Deflation and Disinflation
- **Deflation:** A decrease in the general price level.  
  - Harms borrowers and slows spending, as people expect lower prices in the future.  
- **Disinflation:** A reduction in the inflation rate (prices still rise but more slowly).
