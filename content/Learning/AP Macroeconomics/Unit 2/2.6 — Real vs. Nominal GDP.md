Nominal GDP is the GDP measured in current prices, without adjusting for inflation. For example, if a country produces 10 apples at \$1 each in Year 1 and 10 apples at \$1.25 each in Year 2, nominal GDP increases from \$10 to \$12.50 due to higher prices.

Similarly, Real GDP is the GDP adjusted for inflation, using constant base-year prices to reflect actual production changes. For example, if 10 apples are produced in Year 1 and 10 apples in Year 2, real GDP remains constant regardless of price changes. Real GDP is good because:
- **Measures True Growth:** Shows changes in economic output without distortions from inflation.  
- **Comparability:** Allows for accurate comparisons over time or between countries.  
- **Indicator of Living Standards:** Real GDP per capita (real GDP divided by population) is used to measure average productivity and quality of life.

To calculate real GDP:  
$$
\text{Real GDP} = \frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{GDP Deflator}} \times 100
$$
where GDP inflator is the price index that measures inflation across all goods/services in the economy.

#### Real vs. Nominal GDP Growth
Changes in nominal GDP can result from:  
1. **Changes in Prices:** Reflecting inflation or deflation.  
2. **Changes in Quantity:** Reflecting real economic growth.  

Real GDP focuses only on quantity changes, filtering out price effects.

#### Example
- **Nominal GDP (Year 1):** \$1,000 (10 units at \$100/unit).  
- **Nominal GDP (Year 2):** \$1,500 (15 units at \$100/unit).  
- If prices increased by 20%, the GDP deflator is 120.  
$$
\text{Real GDP (Year 2)} = \frac{\$1,500}{120} \times 100 = \$1,250
$$
