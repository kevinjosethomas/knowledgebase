The Long-Run Aggregate Supply Curve is derived from an expected shift in price level within the [[3.3 — Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS)|short-run aggregate supply]] curve. When the price level is expected to increase, inflation rises, wages rise, and resource costs correspondingly increase. This shifts the short-run aggregate supply curve to the left. Ultimately, this means that the level of output produced when an economy is operating at full employment is what is represented by the long-run aggregate supply. 

The primary difference between the short-run aggregate supply curve and the long-run aggregate supply curve are

**Changes in the price level will cause changes in output and employment in the short run, but not the long run.**

Essentially:
1. First, as the price level increases, we move up the supply curve as producers produce more output in the short run
2. However, as wages and resources also go up, the short-run supply curve shifts to the left **in the long run**

Below is an image of the shift in steps one and two:

Similarly, this shift can happen in the opposite direction (where the price level increases). These circumstances describe a new curve: the long-run aggregate supply curve:

This is quite similar to the [[2.7 — Business Cycle|business cycle]] and [[2.3 — Unemployment|unemployment]], and it also represents the same concepts presented in the [[1.2 — Opportunity Cost & Production Possibilities Curve|production possibilities curve]]. Both curves show our maximum sustaining capacity and the amount we will produce at full employment. Anything that shifts the PPC will also shift the LRAS.
### Long Run Aggregate Supply and the Production Possibilities Curve
The [[1.3 — Production Possibilities Curve|PPC]] describes all combinations of consumer goods and capital goods. Any point on the curve represents full employment (actual unemployment rate = natural unemployment rate). So, a point X on the PPC will represent the quantity of output that the economy is producing at maximum efficiency. This corresponding point on the LRAS represents the value of that output in real GDP.

For both the PPC and the LRAS, we refer to the natural rate of unemployment ($NRU$) and not the actual rate of unemployment ($U_R$). Essentially, a shift in the actual $U_R$ will not shift the PPC or the LRAS, while a shift in the $NRU$ will. Ultimately, the shifters of the Long-Run Aggregate Supply are the same shifters of the PPC, especially a shift in the natural unemployment rate.
