The Long-Run Aggregate Supply Curve is derived from an expected shift in price level within the [[3.3 — Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS)|short-run aggregate supply]] curve. When the price level is expected to increase, inflation rises, wages rise, and resource costs correspondingly increase. Ultimately, this shifts the short-run aggregate supply curve to the left.

Essentially:
1. First, as the price level increases, we move up the supply curve as producers produce more output in the short run
2. However, as wages and resources also go up, the short-run supply curve shifts to the left **in the long run**

Below is an image of the shift in steps one and two:

Similarly, this shift can happen in the opposite direction (where the price level increases). These circumstances describe a new curve: the long-run aggregate supply curve:

This is quite similar to the [[2.2 — Business Cycle|business cycle]] and [[2.3 — Unemployment|unemployment]], and it also represents the same concepts presented in the [[1.2 – Opportunity Cost & Production Possibilities Curve|production possibilities curve]]. Both curves show our maximum sustaining capacity and the amount we will produce at full employment. Anything that shifts the PPC will also shift the LRAS.
