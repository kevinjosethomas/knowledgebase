The Aggregate Supply and Demand Curve is known as the AD-AS model. It includes the ACE framework, which corresponds with the following *ACE* acronym:
1. **A**xes
	- Price level, Real GDP
2. **C**urves
	- Downward Sloping [[3.1 — Aggregate Demand|Aggregate Demand Curve]]
	- Upward Sloping [[3.3 — Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS)|Short-Run Aggregate Supply Curve]]
3. **E**quilibrium Points
	- $PL_E$ meets $Y_E$
### Short-Run Equilibrium
The above ACE acronym and equilibrium is represented in the following graph:

#### Aggregate Market Disequilibrium
In an instance where the price level is higher than the equilibrium price level, we will essentially have something similar to [[2.7 — Market Disequilibrium and Changes in Equilibrium|AP Microeconomics Unit 2.7 Market Disequilibrium]]. In this case, since the $QSRAS$ is greater than the $QAD$, we will have a surplus. As a result, producers will lower their price which will reduce the quantity $QSRAS$ and correspondingly increase $QAD$ until the price level is such that $QSRAS=QAD$. The reverse will happen if the price level is lower than the equilibrium price level. 

This surplus is also similar to [[2.6 — Market Equilibrium and Consumer and Producer Surplus]].

### Long Run Equilibrium 
When the economy is in long-run equilibrium, the current output will equal the potential output, where the potential output is represented by a vertical $LRAS$ curve at $Y_F$. This is represented through the [[3.4 — Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS)|Long-Run Aggregate Supply Curve]].

### Output Gaps
There can also be disequilibrium in the format of recessionary and inflationary gaps. In an instance where the long-run equilibrium quantity is greater than the short-run equilibrium quantity, we have a recessionary gap. Similarly, in an instance where the long-run equilibrium quantity is less than the short-run equilibrium quantity, we have an inflationary gap. This is represented in the following graphs:
