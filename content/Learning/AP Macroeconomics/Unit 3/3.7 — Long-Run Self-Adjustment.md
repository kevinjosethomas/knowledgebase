From [[3.5 â€” Equilibrium in Aggregate Supply and Demand]], we know that an economy can be in three situations:
1. Full-employment
2. Recessionary gap
3. Inflationary gap

When there's no government intervention or policy to help out with recessionary or inflationary gaps, we have long-run self-adjustment. Essentially, in the short run, an economy can be in many places: stagflation, recessionary gaps, and inflationary gaps. However, in the long run, it always ends up where it's supposed to be, which is full employment.

#### Short-Run Supply Self-Adjustment
For example, in the below graph, there's initially an inflationary gap where the economy is heating up and there's a lot of money. But eventually, this also means that workers have higher wages and resources are more expensive, which corresponds with the leftward shift of the short-run aggregate supply curve. Eventually, this positions it back at the long-run aggregate supply. Essentially, the economy **self-adjusts**.

For the positive inflationary output gap, this usually recovers quite quickly. However, for a recessionary gap, the issue might be bigger. For example, if companies start to fire employees because of expenses, we have a lot of unused labour which eventually, due to the multiplier effect, leads to a deep and long recession.
#### Aggregate Demand Self-Adjustment
Even if the economy is at long-run equilibrium, we have full employment, which means there's increased consumer spending and a rightward shift of AD, eventually leading to an inflationary gap. Then again, wages and resource prices will increase, which shifts the short-run aggregate supply curve to the left, and back to full employment.

Conversely, if we're at full employment and there's a decrease in consumer spending, we'll have an AD shift leftward, resulting in a recessionary gap. Once again, theoretically, wages and resource prices will fall, and SRAS will shift right, bringing us back to full employment.
#### Shifts in the LRAS
 Once again, if you have better resources or more resources, we'll have an LRAS shift toward the right (similar to the PPC), signifying economic growth.
