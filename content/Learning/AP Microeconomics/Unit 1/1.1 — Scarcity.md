> Economics is the social science concerned with the efficient use of scarce resources to achieve maximum satisfaction of economic wants

For another detailed explanation, refer to [[Learning/AP Macroeconomics/Unit 1/1.1 — Scarcity|AP Macroeconomics Scarcity]].

Scarcity is the economizing problem. Society has unlimited wants but limited resources – so how do you determine what to produce? 
- How do we feed everybody?
- How do we educate everybody?
### The 5 Main Assumptions of Economics
- Society's wants are unlimited, but ALL resources are limited
- Due to scarcity, choices must be made. Every choice has a cost (trade-off)
- Everyone's goal is to make choices that maximize their satisfaction
- Everyone acts rationally by comparing the marginal costs and marginal benefits of every choice
- Real-life situations can be explained and analyzed through simplified models and graphs
### Using Economic Models:
- Step 1: Explain concepts in words
- Step 2: Use numbers as examples
- Step 3: Generate graphs from numbers
- Step 4: Make generalizations using graphs
### Microeconomics vs. Macroeconomics
- **Microeconomics:** Study of small economic units such as individuals, firms, and Industries (competitive markets, labour markets, personal decision making, etc) pricing and output
- **Macroeconomics:** Study of the large economy as a whole or in it's basic subdivisions (national economic growth, government spending, inflation, unemployment, etc). Topics covered are similar to what you see when you open the newspaper.
### Terminology
- **Theoretical Economics:** Economists use the scientific method to make generalized and abstractions to develop theories
- **Policy Economics:** These theories are then applied to the problem or meet economic goals
- **Positive:** Factual statements. Ex: The price of gas is rising, and gas prices are expected to fall in the future
- **Normative:** Opinion-based statements. Ex: The price of gas is too high
- **Tradeoff:** All decisions involve a trade-off
	- Trade-offs are all the alternatives that we give up whenever we choose one course of action over others
- **Utility:** Satisfaction
- **Marginal:** Additional
- **Allocate:** Distribute
- **Investment:** The money businesses spend to improve their production: \$1,000 new computer, $1,000,000 new factory, etc. Don't confuse investments with stocks, bonds, mutual funds, company shares, etc
- **Goods:** Physical/tangible objects that satisfy needs and wants
	- **Consumer Goods:** created for direct consumption (pizza, sneakers, jeans, etc)
	- **Capital Goods:** created for indirect consumption; business purchases to help produce goods (oven, blenders, knives, etc) 
	- Basically goods that are used to make consumer goods
- **Services:** actions or activities that one person performs for another (teaching, cleaning, cooking, etc)
- **Price:** is the amount that the consumer pays
- **Cost:** is the amount that the seller pays to produce a good
- **Scarcity:** occurs at all times for all goods
- **Shortages:** occur when producers will not or cannot offer goods or services at current prices. Shortages are temporary. Demand > Supply
- **Accountants:** Look only at explicit costs. Explicit costs are traditional "out of pocket costs" of decision making
	- Ex: Going to Disneyland: plane ticket, hotel, transfer to hotel, tickets for disneyland, food, etc
- **Economists:** Look at the explicit and implicit costs. Implicit costs are the opportunity costs such as forgone time and forgone income
	- Ex: if Sidney Crosby leaves the NHL to open a coffee shop: cost of business, lost wages from NHL
### The 4 Factors of Production
- Producing goods and services requires the use of resources
- All resources can be classified as one of the following four **Factors of Production**:
	- **Land:** All natural resources that are used to produce goods and services. Anything that comes from nature: water, sun, plants, oil, trees, stone, animals, etc
	- **Labour:** Any effort a person devotes to a task for which that person is paid (manual labourers, lawyers, doctors, teachers, waiters, etc)
	- **Capital:** Any skills or knowledge gained by a worker through education and experience.
		- **Physical Capital:** tools, machinery, computers, etc
		- **Human Capital:** college degrees, vocational training, etc
	- **Entrepreneurship:** Ambitious leaders that combine the other factors of production to create goods and services
		- Entrepreneurs take the initiative, innovate, and act as the risk bearers; so they can obtain profit
