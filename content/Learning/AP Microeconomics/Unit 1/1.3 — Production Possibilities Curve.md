A **Production Possibilities Curve (PPC)** illustrates the trade-offs and opportunity costs of allocating scarce resources to produce two goods or services. For a detailed explanation, refer to the [[1.3 â€” Production Possibilities Curve|AP Macroeconomics Production Possibilities Curve]].

#### Key Microeconomics-Specific Points
1. **Micro Focus:**  
   - The PPC in Microeconomics is often applied to individual businesses or industries, showing how firms allocate resources between two products.  
   - Example: A factory choosing between producing cars and trucks.
2. **Opportunity Cost in Firms:**  
   - Firms analyze the cost of reallocating resources between products.  
   - Example: Moving workers from car production to truck production increases opportunity cost if workers are more skilled at making cars.
3. **Efficiency in Firms:**  
   - **Productive Efficiency:** Points on the PPC show the least costly production method.  
   - **Allocative Efficiency:** The optimal point reflects what consumers value most (e.g., more trucks if demand for trucks is higher).
4. **Shifters of the PPC in Micro:**  
   - **Change in Resources:** Hiring more skilled workers or securing better materials shifts the PPC outward.  
   - **Technological Advances:** Better production methods improve efficiency for a specific good.  
   - **Trade:** Access to imported inputs or technology can expand production possibilities.
