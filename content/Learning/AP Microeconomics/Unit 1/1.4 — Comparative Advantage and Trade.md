**Comparative advantage** explains how individuals, businesses, or countries benefit from specializing in what they do best and trading for other goods or services. For a detailed explanation, refer to [[1.3 â€” Comparative Advantage and Gains from Trade|AP Macroeconomics Comparative Advantage and Trade]].
### Why do people trade?
1. Assume people didn't trade. What things would you have to go without?
	1. Everything you don't produce yourself! Clothes, car, cell phone, bananas, etc
	2. **Everyone specializes in the production of goods and services and trades it to others**
2. What would life be like if cities couldn't trade with cities or states couldn't trade with states?
	1. Limiting trade would reduce people's choices and make people worse off
	2. **More access to trade means more choices and a higher standard of living**

### Absolute and Comparative Advantage
- **Absolute advantage:** Producer that can produce the most output OR requires the least amount of inputs/resources
- **Comparative Advantage:** Producer with the lowest opportunity cost

Companies and countries should specialize in producing the goods that are cheaper for them to produce.

$$\text{Per unit opportunity cost} = \frac{\text{opp cost}}{\text{units gained}}$$
