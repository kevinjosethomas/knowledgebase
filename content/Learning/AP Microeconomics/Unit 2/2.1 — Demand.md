Demand refers to the different quantities of goods or services that consumers are willing and able to buy at various prices. For detailed notes, refer to [[1.4 â€” Demand|AP Macroeconomics Demand]].

A quick summary:
1. **Law of Demand:**  
   - There is an **inverse relationship** between price and quantity demanded.  
   - As price increases, quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa.
2. **Why the Law of Demand Occurs:**  
   - **Substitution Effect:** Higher prices lead consumers to buy substitutes.  
   - **Income Effect:** Lower prices increase purchasing power.  
   - **Diminishing Marginal Utility:** Additional units provide less satisfaction.  
3. **Shifts in Demand:**  
   - A **shift** occurs when a determinant of demand changes, moving the entire curve.  
   - **5 Shifters of Demand:**  
     1. Tastes and Preferences.  
     2. Number of Consumers.  
     3. Price of Related Goods (Substitutes & Complements).  
     4. Income (Normal & Inferior Goods).  
     5. Future Expectations.
4. **Graphing Demand:**  
   - The demand curve is downward-sloping due to the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded.
