Cross-price elasticity shows how sensitive a product is to a change in price of another good. Essentially, it shows if two goods are substitutes or complements. For example, if P increases by 20%, then quantity decreases 15%.

$$
\frac{\% \Delta \text{ Quantity of Product B}}{\% \Delta \text{ Quantity of Product A}}
$$

If the coefficient is negative (inverse relationship), then the goods are complements. If the coefficient is positive (direct relationship), then the goods are substitutes.
