Elasticity of supply shows how sensitive **producers** are to a change in price. The elasticity of supply is based on time limitations. Essentially, similar to how customers respond to [[2.3 — Price Elasticity of Demand|price changes]], producers need time to produce more.
$$
\frac{\% \Delta \text{ quantity}}{\% \Delta \text{ price}}

1. **Elastic Supply:**  
   - Producers are highly responsive to price changes.  
   - The supply curve is **flatter**.  
   - Typically applies in the **long-run**, as producers have more time to adjust
   - For example, manufactured goods like cars or electronics.
2. **Inelastic Supply:**  
   - Producers are less responsive to price changes.  
   - The supply curve is **steeper**.  
   - Common in the **short-run**, when production adjustments are limited.  
   - For example, agricultural goods (e.g., crops) during a growing season.
3. **Perfectly Inelastic Supply:**  
   - **Quantity supplied does not change**, regardless of price.  
   - Represented by a **vertical line**.  
   - For example, fixed supply goods, like unique artworks or land in a specific location.

Perfectly inelastic is when the Q doesn't change (vertical line) and perfectly elastic is a horizontal line. See:

#### Determinants of Elasticity of Supply
1. **Time Horizon:**  
   - **Short-Run:** Supply is usually inelastic due to limited production flexibility.  
   - **Long-Run:** Supply becomes more elastic as firms can adjust resources and production.  
2. **Flexibility of Production:**  
   - Goods that can be produced quickly and cheaply are more elastic.  
   - For example, t-shirts vs. heavy machinery
3. **Availability of Inputs:**  
   - Easy access to raw materials makes supply more elastic.  
   - For example, abundant wood supply allows quick production of furniture.
4. **Storage Capabilities:**  
   - Goods that can be stored are more elastic since producers can respond to price changes by releasing inventory.  
   - For example, non-perishable goods like canned food.
