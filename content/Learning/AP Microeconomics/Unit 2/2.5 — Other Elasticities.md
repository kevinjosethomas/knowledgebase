Elasticity measures the responsiveness of one variable to changes in another. Beyond the [[2.3 — Price Elasticity of Demand|price elasticity of demand]] and [[2.4 — Elasticity of Supply|supply]], we analyze the income elasticity of demand and cross-price elasticity of demand to understand broader market behaviours.
#### Income-Elasticity of Demand
Income elasticity shows how sensitive a product is to a change in income. Essentially, it shows if a good is normal or inferior.

$$
\frac{\% \Delta \text{ Quantity}}{\% \Delta \text{ Income}}
$$
If the coefficient is negative, then the good is inferior. If the coefficient is positive, then the good is normal. For example, if the income increases by 20% and the quantity decreases 15%, then the good is an **inferior good**. 

### Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand
Cross-price elasticity shows how sensitive a product is to a change in price of another good. Essentially, it shows if two goods are substitutes or complements. For example, if P increases by 20%, then quantity decreases 15%.

$$
\frac{\% \Delta \text{ Quantity of Product B}}{\% \Delta \text{ Quantity of Product A}}
$$

If the coefficient is negative (inverse relationship), then the goods are complements. If the coefficient is positive (direct relationship), then the goods are substitutes.
