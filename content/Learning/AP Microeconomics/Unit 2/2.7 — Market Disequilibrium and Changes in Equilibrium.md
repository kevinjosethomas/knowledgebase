Market disequilibrium occurs when quantity demanded does not equal quantity supplied, causing a surplus or shortage. For more on equilibrium concepts, refer to [[1.6 â€” Market Equilibrium, Disequilibrium, and Changes in Equilibrium|AP Macroeconomics Market Disequilibrium]]

Here is a quick summary:
1. **Surplus:**  
   - Price is **above equilibrium**, so quantity supplied > quantity demanded.  
   - For example, unsold inventory due to high prices.  
2. **Shortage:**  
   - Price is **below equilibrium**, so quantity demanded > quantity supplied.  
   - For example, underpriced concert tickets leading to unmet demand.  
3. **Price Adjustments:**  
   - Surpluses drive prices down, while shortages drive prices up, restoring equilibrium.

#### Changes in Equilibrium
Equilibrium shifts when supply or demand changes.
1. **Demand Shifts:**  
   - **Increase in Demand:** Higher price and quantity (e.g., new trends boost electric car sales).  
   - **Decrease in Demand:** Lower price and quantity (e.g., health scares reduce demand for specific foods).
2. **Supply Shifts:**  
   - **Increase in Supply:** Lower price, higher quantity (e.g., improved production technology).  
   - **Decrease in Supply:** Higher price, lower quantity (e.g., natural disasters disrupt supply).
3. **Simultaneous Shifts:**  
   - The new equilibrium depends on the relative size of demand and supply shifts:  
     - If demand increases more than supply, price and quantity rise.  
     - If supply increases more than demand, price falls, and quantity rises.
