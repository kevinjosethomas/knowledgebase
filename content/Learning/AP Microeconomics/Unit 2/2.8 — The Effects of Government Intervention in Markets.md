### Import Quotas
A quota is a limit on the number of imports. The government sets the maximum amount that can come into the country. Protect domestic producers from a cheaper world price, and also prevent domestic unemployment
### Subsidies
The government gives producers money. The goal is to make more goods that the government deems important. Ex: agriculture (prevent famine), pharmacy, EVs, FAFSA, etc
### Excise Taxes
Excise taxes are the per-unit tax on producers. For every unit made, the producer must pay $ NOT a lumpsum tax (one-time tax). They aim to make less of the goods that the government deems dangerous or unwanted. Ex: "Alcohol sin tax", "Cigarette sin tax", tariff on imported goods, environmentally unsafe products
