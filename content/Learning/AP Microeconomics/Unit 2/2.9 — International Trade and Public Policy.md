Trade allows countries to specialize in goods where they have a comparative advantage, enabling them to produce at a lower opportunity cost and consume beyond their production possibilities curve (PPC).

1. **Absolute vs. Comparative Advantage:**
   - **Absolute Advantage:** Producing more with the same resources.  
   - **Comparative Advantage:** Producing at a lower opportunity cost (basis for trade).  
   - See [[1.4 — Comparative Advantage and Trade]]
1. **Terms of Trade:**  
   - Trade is beneficial when the price of traded goods falls between the opportunity costs of both parties.  
   - For example, if Country A gives up 2 units of wheat for 1 unit of cars, and Country B gives up 1 unit of cars for 3 units of wheat, trade benefits both if 1 car is exchanged for 2–3 units of wheat.
2. **Gains from Trade:**  
   - Increases total output and consumption.  
   - Allows access to goods and services not domestically available or efficiently produced.
#### Public Policy in Trade
1. **Trade Barriers:**  
   - **Tariffs:** Taxes on imports, raising their price. This protects domestic industries but reduces efficiency
   - **Quotas:** Limits on the quantity of imports. This reduces supply, raising prices and benefiting domestic producers
   - **Subsidies:** Government payments to domestic producers to lower costs and boost exports
2. **Arguments for Protectionism:**  
   - Protects infant industries
   - Safeguards jobs in domestic industries
   - Ensures national security by reducing reliance on foreign goods
3. **Criticisms of Trade Barriers:**  
   - Reduces overall efficiency and total surplus
   - Can provoke retaliatory measures, leading to trade wars
   - Limits consumer choices and raises prices
#### Graphical Representation
1. **World Price and Trade:**  
   - **World Price Below Domestic Price:** Country imports the good, benefiting consumers but reducing producer surplus.  
   - **World Price Above Domestic Price:** Country exports the good, benefiting producers but increasing costs for consumers.
2. **Impact of Tariffs:**  
   - Tariffs raise prices, reducing imports and creating deadweight loss.  
   - Consumer surplus decreases, while producer surplus increases.

International trade is fundamental to economic and equilibrium systems and is also largely discussed in relation to GDP within AP Macroeconomics. See [[2.1 — Circular Flow Model and Gross Domestic Product (GDP)]].
