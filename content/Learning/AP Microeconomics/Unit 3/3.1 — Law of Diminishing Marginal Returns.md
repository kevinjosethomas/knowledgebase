Production essentially means converting inputs into output
### Definitions
- **Inputs:** Materials (factors) used to produce outputs
- **Outputs:** Firms must produce output to earn a profit
- **Total Physical Product (TP):** Total output or quantity produced
- **Marginal Product (MP):** Additional output created by additional input (workers)
$$\text{marginal product} = \frac{\Delta\text{total product}}{\Delta\text{input}}$$
- **Average Product (AP):** Output per unit of input
$$\text{marginal product} = \frac{\text{total product}}{\text{units of labour}}$$
- **Fixed Resource:** Doesn't change
- **Accounting Profit:** Total revenue accounting for only explicit costs $$\text{Accounting Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Accounting Costs (Explicit Only)}$$
- **Economic Profit**: Total Revenue accounting for both impge, forgone rent, etc. 

$$\text{Economic Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Economic Costs (Explicit + Implicit)}$$

### Production Analysis
- What happens to total physica product as you hire more workers?
- What happens to marginal product as you hire more workers?
- Why does this happen?

### The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility
As a variable resources (workers) are added to fixed resources (machinery, tools), the additional output produced from each new worker will eventually fall. This is essentially the phrase: *too many cooks in the kitchen*

It is not caused due to laziness, but rather because of limited fixed resources
