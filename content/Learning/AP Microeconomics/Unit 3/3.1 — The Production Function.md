The production function describes how inputs (like labour and capital) are transformed into outputs. It shows the relationship between resource use and production.

### Definitions
- **Inputs:** Materials (factors) used to produce outputs, as described in [[1.2 — Resource Allocation and Economic Systems]]
- **Outputs:** Firms must produce output to earn a profit
- **Total Physical Product (TP):** Total output or quantity produced
- **Marginal Product (MP):** Additional output created by additional input (workers) $$\text{marginal product} = \frac{\Delta\text{total product}}{\Delta\text{input}}$$
- **Average Product (AP):** Output per unit of input $$\text{marginal product} = \frac{\text{total product}}{\text{units of labour}}$$
- **Fixed Resource:** Doesn't change
- **Accounting Profit:** Total revenue accounting for only explicit costs $$\text{Accounting Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Accounting Costs (Explicit Only)}$$
- **Economic Profit**: Total Revenue accounting for both impge, forgone rent, etc.
  $$\text{Economic Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Economic Costs (Explicit + Implicit)}$$

The difference between accounting and economic profit is further described in [[3.4 — Types of Profit]].

#### Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns
When more units of a variable input (e.g., labor) are added to a fixed input (e.g., land or machinery), the additional output ($MP$) eventually decreases. This occurs because fixed inputs limit productivity as more variable inputs are added.

These theories are quite similar to [[1.5 — Cost-Benefit Analysis]] and [[1.6 — Marginal Analysis and Consumer Choice]]. The idea of diminishing returns is also similar to the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility, as described in [[1.4 — Demand]].

Correspondingly, there are three stages of marginal returns:

1. **Stage 1: Increasing Marginal Returns**
   - $MP > AP$: Marginal product rises due to better utilization of inputs (e.g., specialization).
   - Total product grows at an increasing rate.
2. **Stage 2: Diminishing Marginal Returns**
   - $MP \text{ decreases but remains positive}$: Each additional input adds less to total output.
   - Total product grows at a decreasing rate.
3. **Stage 3: Negative Marginal Returns**
   - $MP < 0$: Adding more input decreases total output due to inefficiencies (e.g., overcrowding).

#### Relationships Between TP, MP, and AP
- $MP \text{ intersects } AP \text{ at } AP \text{'s maximum}$
- TP increases as long as $MP > 0$, but the rate of increase slows when $MP$ begins to decline
