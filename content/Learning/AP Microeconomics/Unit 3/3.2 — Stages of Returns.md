There are three stages to production with the increase of variable input. This is because of the [[3.1 â€” Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns|Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns]].

**Stage 1: Increasing Marginal Returns**
- Marginal product will be rising, because of specialization
- TP will be increasing

**Stage 2: Decreasing Marginal Returns**
- Marginal product will be falling
- TP will still be increasing but at a decreasing rate
	- Essentially, each additional worker adds less and less output

**Stage 3: Negative Marginal Return**
- Marginal product is negative
- TP will be decreasing
	- Essentially, workers get in each other's way

### Short Run
- Not a specific amount of time
- A period in which **at least one resource is fixed**. For example, plant capacity/size is not changeable.
### Long Run
- All resources are variable
	- Even the plant capacity/size can be changed
- The long run is really important as it is used for planning. Essentially, firms use it to identify which plant size will result in the lowest per-unit cost.

For example, assume a firm is producing 100 bikes with a fixed number of resources (workers). If the firm decides to double the resources, what happens to the number of bikes?

There are three possibilities:
1. It will **double** (constant return to scale)
	1. Both resource and output increase equally
2. It will **more than double** (increasing returns to scale)
	1. Output increase is greater than resource output
3. It will **less than double** (decreasing returns to scale)
	1. Output increase is less than resource output
### Economies of Scale
Firms that produce more can more optimally use mass production techniques and specialization.

For example:
- A car company that makes 50 cars will have a very high average cost per-car
- However, a car company that can produce 100k cars will have a low average cost per car
- Using mass production techniques, like robots, will cause total cost to be higher but the average cost for each car would be significantly lower

### Identifying Short Run vs Long Run
**Short:**
- Firm is making a profit, and others will follow

**Long:**
- Firms will enter if there is profit
- Firms will leave if there is loss
- All firms break even, and they make **no economic profit**
- Perfectly competitive firms will be extremely efficient
