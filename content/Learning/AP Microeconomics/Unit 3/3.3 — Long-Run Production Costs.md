In the long run, all inputs are variable, and firms can adjust their scale of production. This flexibility allows firms to minimize costs by choosing the most efficient input combination for a given level of output.
#### Economies and Diseconomies of Scale
As firms increase production, their costs per unit may decrease, remain constant, or increase:
1. **Economies of Scale:** Long-run average total cost ($LRATC$) decreases as output increases. This occurs due to factors like specialization, bulk purchasing, and improved technology.
2. **Constant Returns to Scale:** $LRATC$ remains constant as output increases. This happens when a proportional increase in all inputs leads to the same proportional increase in output.
3. **Diseconomies of Scale:** $LRATC$ increases as output increases. This results from inefficiencies like communication breakdowns or coordination challenges in large firms.

In simpler terms, there are three possible outcomes, given in the following example:
Assume a firm is producing 100 bikes with a fixed number of resources (workers). If the firm decides to double the resources, what happens to the number of bikes?

There are three possibilities:
1. It will **double** (constant return to scale)
	1. Both resource and output increase equally
2. It will **more than double** (increasing returns to scale)
	1. Output increase is greater than resource output
3. It will **less than double** (decreasing returns to scale)
	1. Output increase is less than resource output

#### Long-Run Average Total Cost (LRATC) Curve
The $LRATC$ curve is derived from a series of short-run ATC curves, each representing a specific plant size or scale of production. The $LRATC$ is U-shaped because:
- Initially, economies of scale reduce costs as production expands.
- Eventually, due to the [[3.1 â€” The Production Function|Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns]], diseconomies of scale increase costs as production grows too large.

$$LRATC = \frac{\text{Total Cost in the Long Run}}{\text{Output}}$$
