### Relationship Between Production and Cost

**Marginal Cost and Marginal Product**
The marginal cost and marginal product curves are mirror images of each other, and they are typically U-shaped (because of the [[3.1 â€” Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns|Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns]]). When marginal product is increasing, marginal cost will fall. When marginal product is falling, marginal cost will increase.

**Average Total Cost and Marginal Cost**
When marginal cost is below the average total cost, it pulls the average down. When marginal cost is above the average total costs, it pulls the average up. Thus, the marginal cost curve intersects the average total cost curve at its **lowest point**.
