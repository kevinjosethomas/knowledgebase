There are four types of market structures, on a left-to-right axis:
1. Pure Competition
2. Monopolistic Competition
3. Oligopoly
4. Pure Monopoly

Every product sold in a market can be considered one of the above. For example: the OS market system is mildly monopolistic, while the fast food market has monopolistic competition.
### Pure Competition
A perfectly competitive market is characterized by many firms producing identical products, free entry and exit, and firms acting as price takers.
1. **Many Sellers and Buyers:**
   - No single firm or buyer can influence the market price.
   - Each firm produces a small portion of the total market output.
2. **Homogeneous Products:**
   - Goods are identical, so buyers have no preference between products from different sellers.
3. **Free Entry and Exit:**
   - Firms can easily enter or exit the market in response to profit or loss.
   - This ensures long-run economic profit equals zero.
4. **Perfect Information:**
   - All participants know the market price, costs, and quality of goods.
5. **Price Takers:**
   - Individual firms accept the market price determined by supply and demand.

#### Efficiency in Perfect Competition
1. **Productive Efficiency:** 
   - Firms produce at the lowest possible cost.
   - Achieved when $P = \text{minimum } ATC$.
2. **Allocative Efficiency:** 
   - Resources are allocated to their most valued uses.
   - Achieved when $P = MC$, meaning the price reflects the marginal cost of production.
