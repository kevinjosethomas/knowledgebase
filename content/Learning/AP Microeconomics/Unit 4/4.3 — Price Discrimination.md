We just talked about [[4.2 â€” Monopoly|monopolies]] and how they **cannot** price discriminate. Essentially, to sell another unit, monopolies must lower pricesâ€”not just of the next sold unit, but the price of all sold units. As a result, marginal revenue is not the price of the next unit, but the price of the next unit minus the price they could have made from the previous units.
### Price-Discriminating Monopoly
We do have price-discriminating monopolies! In this case, the demand is equal to the marginal revenueâ€”which means they do not need to reduce the price of previous units as they sell more. They sell different prices to different people.

- The equilibrium quantity will be where $MR=MC$, just like all profit-maximizing firms
- The price will NOT be a specific point, as there are multiple different prices (because of discrimination)
- As a result, there is NO consumer surplus. If people are willing to pay more, they will be charged more ðŸ¤©
- All area above the ATC at the equilibrium quantity will be profit.

Below is the graph showing the distinction between non-price-discriminating monopolies and price-discriminating monopolies:
