A light ray is a straight line drawn perpendicular to waves and points in the direction of the wave's travel. They are used to describe the behaviour of light. Lasers are a common example of light that are often modelled as rays.

When light passes through a medium, it can be reflected, transmitted, or absorbed. Reflection occurs when there is a greater difference between the two mediums, and the reflected wave will have a lesser amplitude than the incident wave.

### Law of Reflection
The Law of Reflection states that:
$$\theta_i = \theta_r$$
where
- **Incident Ray:** A ray that hits a surface
- **Reflected Ray:** A ray that reflects off a surface

- **Specular Reflection:** All rays are parallel and the surface is smooth, so all rays that enter reflect in the same way
- **Diffuse Reflection:** A non-smooth surface causes rays to diffuse and spread randomly
