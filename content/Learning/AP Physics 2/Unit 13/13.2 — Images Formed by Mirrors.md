Mirrors are generally one-sided.

- **Plane Mirror:** Flat mirror with specular reflection. Ex: bathroom mirror
- **Curved Mirror:** Concave/convex with a single mirrored side. Imagine using only a section of the sphere, and one is curved inward and one outward

### Concave Mirror
- **Center of Curvature (C):** The point which represents the center of the circle which has the radius of the mirror. It is always perpendicular to the mirror and serves as a normal line to the mirror.
	- If a light is placed at **C**, all rays will reflect off the mirror and return back to the point **C**
