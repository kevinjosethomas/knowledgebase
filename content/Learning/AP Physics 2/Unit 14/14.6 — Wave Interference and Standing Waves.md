Wave Interference is essentially the interaction of two or more [[14.1 — Properties of Wave Pulses and Waves|wave pulses]] or waves—where they travel through each other and overlap rather than bouncing off. The resulting overlapping of waves can be calculated by adding their displacements, which is known as **superposition**. 
## Superposition
Just like we learned in AP Physics 1, **constructive interference** is when we add the amplitudes together, and **destructive interference** is where the amplitudes add up to be zero. Here are some examples:

When we superimpose waves, we get radically different frequencies. For example, while a sound wave of 440 Hz is quite similar to 441 Hz, the result of superimposing them is $|441 - 440|$ which is 1 Hz.
## Standing Waves
A standing wave usually results from the interference of two waves that are confined to a region and travelling in opposite directions. These standing waves have **nodes** and **antinodes**. A node is a point on a standing wave where the amplitude is equal to zero, while an antinode is a point on a standing wave where the amplitude is at an absolute maximum

### Open Tubes
In open tubes, the first harmonic is created when $\lambda = 2L$ which means that half of the wavelength fits in the tube. Correspondingly, the second harmonic is created when $\lambda = L$ and the third harmonic is created when $\lambda = \frac{2}{3}L$. From the below chart, you can see the relationship between the frequencies of the different harmonics (the integer coefficient increases by 1 each time):

Open tubes have the same harmonic structure as standing waves on a string. Open tubes have an air pressure variation which is where the nodes and antinodes switch, and this variation is exactly identical to the harmonic structure of fixed strings:

### Fixed End Tube
When waves in a fixed end tube reach the closed end, they [[14.3 — Boundary Behaviour of Waves and Polarization|reflect]] back with their amplitude in the inverse direction. Thus, a wave in a closed end tube will have its pulses reflect and create another wave, which correspondingly creates the interference and superposition.

For closed tubes, the harmonics are as follows: the first harmonic will have $\lambda =  4L$, the second harmonic will have $\lambda = \frac{4}{3}L$, and the third harmonic will have $\lambda = \frac{4}{5}L$. The corresponding frequencies will have integer coefficients increasing by 2 each time:
