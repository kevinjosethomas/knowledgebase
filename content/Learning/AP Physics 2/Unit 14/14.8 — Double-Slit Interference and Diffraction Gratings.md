As we learned in [[14.7 — Diffraction]], diffraction occurs when waves spread around the edges of an obstacle or through an opening, and then [[14.6 — Wave Interference and Standing Waves|interferences]] with itself. it occurs for both sound waves and light waves. When a wave diffracts, the obstacle essentially acts as a new source of waves.

Here are some quick facts about sound waves and all electromagnetic waves:

| Sound Waves          | EM Waves              |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Longitudinal         | Transverse            |
| 340m/s in air        | 300,000,000m/s in air |
| Can't be polarized   | Can be polarized      |
| Interference effects | Interference effects  |
In double-slit interference,
- a greater wavelength will result in widely-spaced maxima
- a greater distance to the screen will result in widely-spaced maxima
- a greater spacing between openings will result in closely-spaced maxima

Continuing on the diagram in [[14.7 — Diffraction]], we have the following illustration and the derived formula:

We can manipulate the small angle equation to fit into $y = mx + b$ by assuming $mL$ is the x-value. When we're looking at the first dark spot ($m=1$), the x-axis will simply represent $L$ which is the distance to the screen.
