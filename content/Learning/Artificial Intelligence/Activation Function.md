Activation functions are parts of artificial neural networks that calculate the output of a node based on its inputs and weights. Essentially, it decides if a [[Perceptron]] should be activated or not. Typically, all hidden layers use the same activation function, and the output layer might use a different activation function to produce sensible outputs. The purpose of activation functions is to add non-linearity to the neural network.
There are two main types of activation functions:
- Linear Activation Function
- Non-Linear Activation Function

Some of the most widely used activation functions are:
- [[Rectifier Linear Unit Activation Function (ReLU)]]
- [[Sigmoid Activation Function]]
- [[Softmax Activation Function]]
- [[Hyperbolic Tangent Activation Function (tanh)]]
