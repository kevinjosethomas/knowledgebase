AlphaGo was a model developed by DeepMind which achieved computational superiority in the game of Go, which was long considered one of the most challenging games for a computer to master.

AlphaGo has a policy and value head, which predicts potential moves and predicts the likelihood of winning respectively. It was trained with [[Reinforcement Learning (RL)]], playing millions of games against itself and learning from wins/losses. 

After AlphaGo, DeepMind developed [[AlphaZero]], a neural chess engine which beat Stockfish, the state-of-the-art in superhuman chess play. In just 24 hours of self-play, AlphaZero achieved a superhuman level of play in chess, shogi, and Go by defeating Stockfish, Elmo, and AlphaGo Zero (its predecessor).
