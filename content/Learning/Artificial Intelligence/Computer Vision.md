Computer vision is a field of AI that focuses on machines interpreting and understanding visual information. This enables computers to gain insights from images, videos, or real-time camera feeds.

This is primarily achieved with [[Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)]] or [[Transformers]]. Some notable computer vision models are [[AlexNet]], [[VGGNet]], and [[Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)]].
