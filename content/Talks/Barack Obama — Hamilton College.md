- "The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice"
	- From Martin Luther King, progress is a sine curve and there will be many lows; humans have to constantly work towards justice
- Much of what holds us back—politically, socially, personally—is fear of the unfamiliar. Growth depends on walking toward that fear, not away from it
	- Humans inherently are scared of people who don't look like us; facing that diversity is what can propel us forward
- True communication is about storytelling, clarity, conviction, and most importantly, listening to others
- Democratic norms aren't self-sustaining. Rule of law, freedom of speech, and the peaceful transfer of power require active defense—especially when they stop being convenient.
	- Civic courage means standing for principle even when the crowd has moved on. It's not enough to believe in justice or equality when it’s easy; the work begins when there's something to lose
- Polarization deepens when people stop seeing one another as whole human beings. Curiosity, real-world community, and daily contact with difference are the antidotes.
- As for AI: coding, law, finance, and other white-collar jobs are already being reshaped. The defining challenge won’t be whether we can outsmart machines—but whether we can deepen what makes us human.
	- “Be less concerned about beating machines,” he said. “Be more concerned with developing the parts of yourself that machines can’t replicate.”

### Communication, Storytelling, and Leadership
- Effective communication is built through deliberate practice, repetition, and the willingness to self-edit over time
- The most important part of communication is *conviction*. Messaging works when it comes from true belief, not when it's engineered to impress
	- Clarity comes from knowing what you stand for. Communication begins not with performance, but with the question: _What do I actually believe?_
	- Writing forces sharper thought—translating an idea to paper makes it real, precise, and harder to fake
- Best advice for any communicator: **talk like a real person**. Complexity doesn’t require abstraction—speak like you mean it, not like you're quoting a textbook
	- Information without emotional context is forgettable. Data and policy mean little unless they’re attached to the human lives they affect
	- Voter conversations, not statistics, were what changed the tone and direction of his early speeches
	- Listening is the difference between knowing what matters in theory and understanding how it actually plays out in someone’s life
	- Even at the highest levels of leadership, listening is the first skill to (re)learn—not to reply, but to understand
- Failure to persuade doesn’t always mean failure to communicate—some truths, like the urgency of gun reform, meet resistance no matter how clearly they’re delivered
	- Still, the arc of persuasion is long. “Eventually you get a breakthrough—then people try to backslide—and then you go back at it again”
- Conviction doesn’t cancel humility. Holding space for disagreement is how better ideas emerge and trust is built

### Challenges to Democracy and Civic Norms
- The erosion of democratic norms in the US goes beyond politics—but is a deeper breakdown in shared values, civic culture, and constitutional guardrails
	- For much of the post-WWII era, Democrats and Republicans—despite fierce disagreements—shared a basic respect for the Constitution, civil liberties, and the rule of law. That consensus has faded
	- Core institutions are increasingly treated as optional or disposable, especially when they conflict with personal or party interests
	- A bloated, slow, and often unresponsive government has added fuel to public cynicism—making trust in democracy harder to sustain
	- Rising inequality and rapid demographic shifts have left many feeling excluded from the promise of America—and doubtful that the system still serves them
- When difference feels threatening—when the other side no longer seems like fellow citizens—democratic compromise becomes rare, and extremism easier to justify
- As for what's happening today (April 2025):
	- The authoritarian impulse shows up subtly—through intimidation of universities, threats against law firms, and the quiet suppression of dissent
	- “Imagine if I had pulled Fox News’s credentials from the press room…”
	- Overreach, which was once unthinkable, is now too often tolerated
	- Authoritarianism rarely announces itself. It creeps in through normalization—of shortcuts, excuses, and the erosion of shared standards
- Democracy depends on restraint—on people choosing not to abuse power, even when they could
	- America’s strength came not from natural advantages, but from trust in fair rules. “You didn’t have to pay bribes or hire someone’s cousin to get a permit—that’s how we built the economy.”
	- “The most important office in this democracy is the citizen.”
- For the past many decades, things have been relatively calm and easy. It has been easy to uphold justice and stand for what is right
	- Civic courage now requires actual risk—financial, reputational, social
	- Institutions must be willing to sacrifice comfort for principle—even if it means losing money, access, or goodwill.
	- Complacency is a civic illness. Good intentions aren’t courage—and silence, when it’s no longer safe to speak, is complicity

### Political Polarization and Social Division
- The divide today isn't just ideological but also emotional
- Tribal politics—where identity is built not on values or community, but on opposition to the perceived other
	- “People don’t just disagree; they feel threatened by the existence of someone who sees the world differently"
	- A major driver of this rift is the loss of everyday connection—few spaces remain where people of different backgrounds regularly interact
	- As more women, immigrants, and people of colour entered public life, the landscape of power shifted—and for some, that diversity triggered defensiveness rather than openness
- Curiosity offers a path out
	- “Just being curious and listening to other people and their stories changes how we see them.”
	- People are rarely one-dimensional. “Uncles who say crazy things” might also be the ones who taught you to skate, fixed your car, or showed up when it mattered
	- Online spaces flatten this complexity. Without face-to-face interaction, it’s easier to mock, dismiss, or dehumanize.
		- And of course, it's much easier to surround yourself in echo chambers where you simply surround yourself with people who agree with the ideas you agree with
		- See [[Quantifying social organization and political polarization in online platforms (Waller & Anderson 2021)]] for our lab!
	- Without disagreement in person, accountability shrinks—and the incentive to understand vanishes
	- The pandemic deepened isolation, making digital life even more dominant
- The information ecosystem is shifting in dangerous ways—truth is increasingly fragmented, manipulated, and distrusted
	-  Deepfakes, AI-generated content, and algorithmic manipulation are making it harder by the day to separate signal from noise
	- A shared reality is essential to any functioning democracy—“We cannot cooperate if we don’t see the same facts.”
	- Images carry psychological power—bypassing logic and going straight to fear, anger, and tribal reaction
		- Social media, once a tool for grassroots empowerment, now rewards outrage, division, and ideological purity over real conversation.
- Polarization can be repaired, but not through better arguments alone. The work begins by rebuilding community—through shared spaces, mutual respect, and collaborative effort
	- Censorship isn’t the answer. “You let them speak and then you tell them why they’re wrong. That’s how you win the argument"
- Democracy happens where difference is allowed to speak

### Technology, AI, and the Future of Work
- AI is poised to be more transformative than the smartphone—and it’s arriving faster than most people realize
	- It’s cognitive labour—not just physical—being replaced by AI in coding, law, finance, and beyond.
	- Current AI systems already outperform 60–70% of professional coders—white-collar jobs once considered “safe” are now firmly within the blast radius
	- The top talent will adapt by using AI as an amplifier—but routine, rules-based labor will increasingly be machine territory.
- Not just a blue-collar disruption—but a redefinition of what work looks like for the professional class
	- Society will need to reorganize itself around this change—rethinking jobs, income, and how purpose is defined in a world where human labor isn’t always economically necessary
		- This also heavily ties into [[Short Talk with Tom Preston-Werner]] and how capitalism is a threat when he have increasing automation and abundance
	- In this context, critical thinking, storytelling, and emotional intelligence become even more important
	- “Machines can’t tell stories like we can, or inspire a child, or get people to believe in a common mission.”
	- The most valuable traits in the age of AI won’t be technical—they’ll be human: leadership, compassion, clarity, trust.
- As labor shifts, deeper questions emerge—if jobs go away or morph beyond recognition, where will people find meaning?
	- New models of income distribution and new social contracts will be necessary—conversations that need to start now, not after disruption has fully landed
	- Left unchecked, AI will widen inequality. Those with access to advanced tools will pull even further ahead—unless guardrails are built to level the playing field
	- Once again, heavily tied into what [[Short Talk with Tom Preston-Werner]] talked to us about over a year ago
- This moment will redefine what education should deliver. Rote memorization is obsolete—adaptability, emotional fluency, and trust-building are now at the core
	- More than a technical revolution, this is a philosophical one—forcing a reckoning with what makes human beings unique and indispensable.
- The real task isn’t to outperform machines—but to cultivate what machines can’t replicate
