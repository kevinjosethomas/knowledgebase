- “What good is it if we call this the greatest city in the world if the people who built it can’t afford to live here?”
  - Zohran Mamdani, 33, emerged as the presumptive Democratic nominee for NYC mayor by running a campaign rooted in economic dignity, grassroots momentum, and outsider appeal
    - He was virtually unknown—1% name recognition at launch—no institutional backing, and openly opposed by the city’s largest paper
    - His victory stunned political insiders and signalled a potential reshaping of New York's political coalition
- His message: re-centering politics on the material realities of everyday life
  - Positioned affordability as the great equalizer—something that transcends race, class, and party
  - “We didn’t just win progressive districts. We won Trump districts. We won Adams districts. That’s the power of a shared economic vision”

### Affordability

- Framed NYC’s central crisis not as crime, immigration, or culture—but as the basic cost of living
  - Rent, transportation, groceries, and childcare are out of reach for working-class New Yorkers
  - Voters across all backgrounds—immigrants, Black voters, Trump supporters—consistently cited economics, not ideology, as their main concern
  - “People told me they voted for Trump because life was more affordable four years ago”
- Key policy planks:
  - Freeze rent for over 2 million rent-stabilized tenants
  - Make the slowest bus system in the country fast and free
  - Deliver universal childcare
  - Establish a network of publicly owned grocery stores
- Funding mechanism:
  - Raise NYC’s corporate tax rate to match NJ’s (11.5%)
  - Add a 2% income tax on those making $1 million or more

### Grassroots

- Campaign ran entirely outside the party machine
  - No establishment support, began with two staffers
  - Won endorsements only after victory looked inevitable—Warren, Nadler, and others came aboard post-primary
- Unprecedented youth turnout reshaped the electorate
  - Top three voting age groups: 18–24, 25–29, 30–34
  - Countered the conventional wisdom that the left only wins low-turnout races
- Broke through partisan and demographic divides
  - Won in neighbourhoods that voted heavily for Trump and Adams (current mayor)
  - Focused on “a vision people could vote for” rather than fear-based opposition
  - “The goal isn’t to win arguments. The goal is to represent all 8.5 million New Yorkers—including the ones who didn’t vote for me”
- Critics argue the mayor lacks the power to implement his agenda
  - Acknowledges NYC’s dependence on state government; says bold ideas require coalition-building in Albany
  - Cites past legislative success: $4B in new taxes under Cuomo, half a billion in debt relief for taxi drivers, NYC’s first free bus pilot
- Open to alternative funding mechanisms, but not to backing off core promises
  - “If there’s another way to fund rent freezes or free buses, I’m all ears. But I’ll be judged by results, not rhetoric”
- Pushback from Adams and others about his privileged background
  - Adams accuses him of being out of touch due to his upbringing (son of a famous filmmaker and academic)
    - “The childhood I had should be every New Yorker’s. That it isn’t is the problem I’m trying to solve”

### Identity & Islamophobia

- First Muslim and South Asian mayoral primary winner in NYC history
  - Endured a barrage of racist and Islamophobic attacks—accused of celebrating 9/11, called a terrorist, targeted with deportation demand
- Sees his campaign as pushing marginalized voices into the center
- Draws deeply from religious values in his politics
  - Ramadan taught him what it meant to serve strangers and build solidarity without conditions
  - “My faith teaches me to help those in need and harm no one—that’s what I bring to public life”

### Expanding the Coalition

- Preparing to run citywide in a general election that includes Republicans and independents
  - Already saw support from non-Democrats who tried to vote for him in the primary
- Admits to weak support among older Black voters; says trust must be earned
  - Initially wasn’t even invited to churches; now he’s “double-booked on Sundays”
  - Plans to spend the coming months reintroducing himself and building credibility one conversation at a time
- Rejected politics of exclusion—wants to serve even those who fear him
  - Billionaires threatening to leave? He wants them to stay
  - Skeptical Jewish voters? He commits to protecting Jewish New Yorkers and combating hate through action, not platitudes
  - “Where people feel misunderstood, I will seek to understand. Where they feel hurt, I will try to heal”
