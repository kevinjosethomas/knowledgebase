As I board my flight to New York in an hour, my month-long trip to Toronto comes to an end— the very first time I've traveled and lived  entirely by myself: no roommate to share the month with, no hackathon to grind through, and no startup I'm living at.

Initially, when I started writing this two weeks ago, I wanted to break this post into three parts: the premise of opportunity and immigration; adulting and my concern about letting go; and finally, what I think the immediate future holds for me. I think each deserves an article of its own, but let's see where this takes us.

## opportunity & immigration

Each time I've landed in a new city these past three years, I've felt a strong yearning and excitement for what is to come. Touchdown is the very beginning of whatever ardent journey is about to begin. Landing in Toronto however, while still bringing out excitement for the next month I was going to spend at the lab, also brought out a eep sensed of gratitude for where I am today.

Just about six years ago, my family and I landed in this very same city, just having moved from India. In a span of fourteen days, we found out we would be moving out, and in that single fortnight, we packed up as much of our life as we could fit in eight suitcases, and flew out of the one country I had considered home for the entirety of my life. Today, after many years of settling into this new home, growing up to become the person I am, and doing my very best to make use of the opportunity this country has given me, I was landing in the very same airport again.

Recently, over multiple late night debates with Julia, we have quite extensively discussed the premise of:
- whether an individual's intelligence is a measure of brain capability or, adversely, simply a metric of whether they are perceived as intelligent or not
- whether individuals have control over their own life or, conversely, most of our life is predetermined at birth
- whether success is truly about effort and ability, or whether it is overwhelmingly dictated by circumstance and access

While our conversations were incessantly (and entertainingly) long and often strayed far from the premise, we mostly converged on the belief that people grow into the spaces they are given. Moving to Canada, for example, was my parents taking an active step to place me in a bigger vessel I could grow into, rather than overflowing in a smaller one. Similarly, Julia heading from Burnaby South to Harvard was a direct result of her constant struggle in a restrictive vessel, now replaced by one where her potential could fully thrive.

After spending most of the past two years actively seeking out opportunities to discover myself, these discussions made me think about exploring the potential of the space I already occupy, rather than constantly seeking bigger better ones. For example, I've always been incredibly envious of the vast amount of opportunity in competitive American high schools—where it is the norm to take multivariable calculus in high school, dual enrol in local universities, and actively volunteer at frontier research labs. Sure, many of these areas (Palo Alto, Boston, etc) are self-selecting hotspots of very successful individuals who prioritize academic success for their own children. But still, having pitched at The Harker School when I was working in Palo Alto, or when talking to some of my high-achieving friends in these places, I do strongly believe that people in my school (and even my friends in India) could achieve just as much if they had access to the same opportunity.

I can't help but think about what more my graduating class would have achieved if it were the norm to take AP Calculus BC in Grade 11 rather than 12, to dual enrol for UBC courses rather than pile on performative extra-curriculars, or even to just be more intentional about our actions instead of doomscrolling our lives away. Even when Julia and I brought this up to our Calculus teacher in another long conversation this summer, he talked about he shared the same concerns for his own children.

At the end of the day, while I am in awe of how much society has achieved (like [[Air Travel]]), I do strongly believe that the vast majority of human potential is largely untouched. The *average* is only as low as we intend for it to be, and our potential is far higher than the opportunity we are provided (which is the real limiting factor of our success). Despite how naively idealist I may sound, I do think we are functioning in a pretty sub-optimal manner and could be doing a lot better for our future.

## adulting & letting go

On a more personal note, this trip comes at a pretty consequential turning point of my life; after all, your last summer break is a very special moment—and also a time to bid an honest farewell. For the past many months, I’ve idealized all the things I wanted to do over the summer break. I vividly remember sitting in the AP exam room earlier this May, planning out all my aspirations for this break: one month continuing my work at UofT, two weeks continuing my work in Palo Alto, time with my cousins and grandparents in Seattle, daily hikes and road trips with my high school friends, and savouring my day-to-day with my family. It was going to be golden—creating the best memories with my best friends and family, all while working enough to give myself the opportunities I wanted in the coming years.

It wasn’t until the school year actually ended when it occurred to me that… this was it. Summer break wasn’t an indefinite amount of time that would wait for me to do all the things I wanted to do before slipping away. It was now, and it would be impossible to do everything I wanted to do. My life was suddenly going to be a very real thing, and I would no longer be operating within the cozy inconsequential sandbox I’ve spent the last 18 years of my life in.

So, without realizing it, I unknowingly picked a path at the crossroads—choosing to spend this month working in Toronto over relishing the last few weeks with the friends that defined my last half decade. Yet, the month has gone by and, while I expected to return regretful of my thoughtless choice, I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunities I get to take... and honestly satisfied for the work I get to do. I absolutely love everyone who makes me who I am and I do enjoy the comfort of home, but these trips (and the change they bring) remind me how much I hate the stagnancy and complacency of staying where I am.

## the immediate future

As for the coming time, I will be moving back east to study Computer Science at the University of Waterloo for the next five years. With this, I do plan to continue working with Ashton at the University of Toronto for the coming months (a vessel I'm still learning a lot within). Unfortunately, I'll be leaving both Hack Club and the British Columbia Youth Developer Collective—albeit I'm really glad I could make BC a slightly bigger landscape for people aspiring to computer science, technology, and robotics.

As I've been warned, the next five years will be a busy flurry of intellectually demanding courses, highly competitive job interviews and placements, and a lot of very new experiences—often all on the very same day. I'm especially excited my advanced level 1A courses (finally learning theoretical cs & lin alg, but hopefully not losing 12 hours a day to it), constantly being surrounded by people smarter and more ambitious than myself, and hopefully more opportunities to work with incredible people while exploring interesting ideas at innovative companies.

See you soon :)
