- **Picking your mission**
	- Find role models: read books and biographies; listen to podcasts and audiobooks
	- Try lots of different things—every single thing you can possibly try
		- Life is a lot of different games and you can do anything. Look at each as a math function you're trying to optimize. You need to ensure you're finding the global maximums—not getting stuck in the locals. More importantly, be very very careful in choosing the functions you choose to optimize for—because you definitely can't pick all of them
	- The Hamming Question: “What are the most important problems in your field, and why aren’t you working on them?”
	- Eventually, you know what you want to do and you focus on that. Cut out all the noise—other's expectations of you, distracting goals outside of what you want to focus on
	- **When you stop playing other people's games, you start competing with everyone else rather than against everyone else**
- **Be humble**
	- KT: "Morality is probably one of the most important values we've been raised with: I always do my best to always work harder than I ever have before; I always do my best to serve the people around me the best I can; I always do my best to be a positive influence and smile for the people around me. I always do my best to be *good*—why do I feel like I have worse outcomes than other people who blatantly cheat, manipulate, and operate dishonestly?"
	- One fascinating conversation:
		- "Because you're playing a repeated game—they're treating it like a one-shot. In a one-shot payoff matrix—defection is the dominant strategy. If there’s no tomorrow, cheating makes sense. It gives the highest short-term reward, and there's no cost to burning trust."
		- "Life isn’t one round. It’s an iterated game, closer to infinite. In that setup, mutual cooperation becomes the rational equilibrium—it consistently outperforms defection over time."
		- "What feels like morality is often just long-term strategy: you’re optimizing for cumulative reward, not immediate wins. The outcomes come later, but they scale better and last longer."
		- KT: Sure, makes sense in theory—but continuous short-term losses stacking up makes it harder to stay committed. Even if I believe in the long game, missing the payoff again and again starts to erode my conviction. Also  winning makes it easier to win more—which makes it easier for cheaters to win more
		- "Sticking with the long game doesn’t mean ignoring the short term—it means accepting that short-term variance doesn’t reflect long-term value. It’s hard. Can you absorb losses without shifting course?"
	- Another powerful perspective:
		- The path to success is not linear
		- There’s little fulfillment in being exploitative
		- Just because good things don’t necessarily always go to good people, doesn’t mean that doing things out of good intention is bad
- **Seek discomfort**
	- Pull out a sheet of paper and write down the 30 things you fear the most
	- Starting from the easiest, go through every single thing on the list and fight it the hardest you can
	- When you conquer your fears, you're quite literally the strongest person you possibly can be
	- Read The Courage to Be Disliked
- If you make your own decisions and it doesn't work out, atleast it's your own decision you regret—not someone else's
- "People out in the world will want to expect and demand your goodness, but know that you don’t owe them it"
