It’s the 28th of February and I’m on a flight from Vancouver to Texas (Houston and then Austin) to organize Hack Club Scrapyard. I have the window seat :) I’ve been fortunate to be in this position dozens of times—airpods in, flying thousands of miles across land and water—but it always hits just as hard as the first, especially when I’m alone.

Air travel always reminds me of how absolutely insane human innovation and ingenuity is, but also how much more there is to achieve if we keep accelerating at this pace. Right this second, I can look around me and just try to comprehend the current unfathomable reality: I’m in an enclosed pressurized aluminum tube flying a few hundred miles above the surface of the Earth, travelling at a velocity fast enough to get me across the continental United States in barely a few hours. I can look below me: the dozens of cities scattered across our path—each home to millions of different people, animals, children, families, students…all currently living their very own complicated eventful lives. Cars, cargo ships, highways, skyscrapers, bridges, factories, oil rigs. I can look above me: the vast blue-gray sky, undoubtedly dotted with other planes, satellites, spacecrafts, stars, planets, and more. It’s absolutely surreal.

We often see the timeline of human innovation: how long it took to invent the wheel, learn how to fan flames, work together to build cities. But also how exponentially fast we’re growing now: from the first flight barely a hundred years ago to democratized air travel for the layperson today; from closet-sized computers with megabytes of memory to pocket-sized phones and laptops with terabytes of storage; from a clustered disconnected world to interconnected civilizations with global trade, instant communication, and a consistent effort towards positive causes: fostering peace and health , fighting climate change and infant mortality, and renouncing tyranny and authoritarianism (kinda!). With humans growing at such an exponential rate, what do we stand to achieve in just the next decade? the next century? the next millennium?

That’s the other thing that air travel reminds me of. The vast uninhabited natural landscapes that can still be preserved. The clear skies and space that we have still barely explored. The vast deep oceans that escape all human intelligence. I see beautiful endless snow-tipped mountain ranges, entirely uninhabited deserts, lakes and oceans with no visible civilization, and also so much variation: biome to biome with absolutely no signs of human life. We’ve achieved so much with barely 5% of our lab being visibly inhabited and developed by humans. Do we really know anything at all?

Given our pace of innovation, and given my belief (assumption) that our innovation never converge and flatten out, and given that there isn’t a Great Filter-esque phenomenon that will end the human race… what’s to say that nothing is impossible? We can travel faster than the speed of light, we can make space tourism as cheap as a bus ticket, we can ensure safe time travel, we can develop the ability to teleport. If the Laws of Physics are only developed through a sample of just one single planet (that hasn’t been fully explored as well!) or just one single galaxy or just through just a few millennia of research, I refuse to believe that their constraints will actually hold us back for much longer.
