One month ago, our organizing team of 13 high school students from around Canada and the United States got together in Austin, Texas. Over the last four months, we had been working towards organizing Scrapyardâ€”a global high school hackathon happening in Austin and 60+ cities around the world. Joining us that weekend were 70 other local high schoolers from Texas, as well as around 30 other students from all around the worldâ€”Switzerland, Singapore, Romania, New Zealand, and many other beautiful cities. It was real. [Scrapyard](https://scrapyard.hackclub.com/) was happening.

I remember quite distinctly, back in 2019 when I was first moving from Bangalore to Canada, I had dreamt of exactly this: coding clubs in middle and high school, friends with the same passion as mine, monthly hackathons with talented students, and a community of driven kids just doing the coolest stuff ever. Unfortunately, middle school in Toronto disappointed: no coding classes, no programming clubs, and no events and opportunities for me either. High school in Vancouver was marginally better: we had AP Computer Science classes and I got to start our first programming club... but it was only a handful of students who really enjoyed the sport. I had spent the last year building the [British Columbia Youth Developer Collective](https://bcydc.ca/) and working towards creating that dream in British Columbiaâ€”but still, Scrapyard was going to be different.

Amongst the jam-packed ~65 hours we got to spend together (of which we unfortunately only spent about 7 hours sleeping), we got to create a truly beautiful spaceâ€”close friends with a shared passion for continually learning and building, talented teenagers with a knack for trying new things out, and a true community of driven kids just doing the coolest things ever.

For the past year, Hack Club has given me an immeasurable amount of opportunityâ€”through it's online community of over 50,000 teenagers and also it's in-person events in San Francisco and across Canada. From meeting the most inspiring students and friends to exploring the cities I've always dreamt of visiting, Hack Club has totally changed my lifeâ€”both in the huge noticeable shifts in the people I'm fortunate to be surrounded by and the opportunities I've been given access to, but also in the tiny changes in my outlook on things and how I approach the world.

It is unfathomable to even consider that Scrapyard will have the same chain reactions that other Hack Club events have had: dozens of people will find the best of friends just like I was fortunate to, many young students will get into coding and art and amazing hobbies they've been scared to get into, and two weeks after Scrapyard Flagship, many of our attendees will go on to run their own local Scrapyard eventsâ€”each with their own little chain reactions that make this world a slightly better place.

Paraphrasing a message I wrote to Ruby when I returned to Vancouver after Scrapyard Flagship:

> Because of Hack Clubâ€”each and every one of the 50,000 teenagers in the community, each and every student who attended Scrapyard, and each and every organizer who I was lucky to learn and work withâ€”there was another Ruby out there who found their home at Hack Club that weekend... suddenly surrounded by a beautiful group of people: inspired to create new things and make new friends and share their gifts with others
> 
> Maybe itâ€™s the elementary school brothers who walked in with smiles and worked insanely hard to learn and meet new people (even winning a prize at the end!)â€¦ or maybe itâ€™s the girl who walked in intimidated by the prospect of a hackathon before realizing how awesome itâ€™s going to be and even getting her sister over.  Maybe itâ€™s the unsure Austin locals who walked in without knowing what to expect and then proceeded to have the best weekend of their lives, or the dozens of international students who have flew through 20 hours of flights after waiting for this event for many weeks.
> 
> We did this over the weekend, weâ€™re going to help others do it two weeks from now, and for weeks and months and even years from today, this is going to reverberate and continue to have a huge positive impact all around the world.

And well, so we did. Two weeks later, on March 15th, our team at the British Columbia Youth Developer Collective hosted Scrapyard Vancouverâ€”bringing together 85 students from all around the province to build stupid scrappy projects, and also breaking our previous record of British Columbia's biggest youth hackathon. And at that exact same moment, over 60 Scrapyard satellite hackathons took place around the worldâ€”each bringing together dozens of local students to create something new.

 Thank you to Hack Club and the entire Scrapyard organizing team for such an insane opportunity :) From moving the entire flagship event from Los Angeles to Austin (Palisades fire ðŸ˜”) to helping so many organizers run their own events, organizing Scrapyard was truly a feat. Honestly, Ruby deserves a special shoutout for carrying so muchâ€”from merchandise to logistics to organization to customer support; and also for holding us all accountable. 
 
 Thank you to our amazing team at the British Columbia Youth Developer Collective for pulling through with Scrapyard Vancouverâ€”especially Vuk, I can't wait to see how you grow BCYDC next year :) Vancouver held one of the largest Scrapyard satellite events that weekendâ€”and through our work at BCYDC, our hackathons are now almost on-par with THE cities... New York, San Francisco, Toronto, and so on!

Thank you to the amazing students who attended Scrapyard Flagship, Scrapyard Vancouver, and all the other Scrapyard satellites around the world! I can't wait to see everyone continue cooking up the craziest stuff over the next few yearsâ€”and of course, the next few decades.

I'm turning 18 in exactly 20 days and it's quite a strange thing to even consider. I've spent the last decade trying to grow up and be an adult; always working my hardest to do things outside of my capabilities and be seen as more than just a child. But now, as I get closer and closer to 18, it is a strangely frightening prospectâ€”so I thought I'd take it as an opportunity to spend some time and write.

So yeah! Here I am sitting in the backyard of a 15-million-dollar hacker house in Palo Altoâ€”just after wrapping up another 20-hour day at K-Scale. I think things have worked out pretty well so far. I can't wait to see where it goes.

Thank you Hack Club, thank you Canada, and thank you to all my amazing friends and family :)
