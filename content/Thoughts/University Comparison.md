Below is a ChatGPT Deep Research prompt and response I made on March 12th 2025. At this time, I was extremely fortunate to have just received the Djavad Mowafaghian Presidential Scholar Award from the University of British Columbia—a \$72,000 full-ride scholarship to attend the school. Unfortunately, the deadline to accept the scholarship was on March 28th—a few hours after I heard back from most schools in the United States and most likely a few months before I heard back from the University of Waterloo, which was the only other school which would make more financial sense. As a result, I figured it would make sense to weigh all my choices so I could make an immediate determination in a few hours if I needed to. All data from this prompt was condensed into the following sheet:

![[Pasted image 20250413020954.png]]

As evident in the comparison and also the prompt—this was heavily tuned to my own requirements (which is visibly a very flawed cali-or-bust mentality); and of course, doesn't represent any meaningful distinction between these amazing institutions for most individuals. Regardless, very useful for me! Deep Research is super cool :)

## 1. Cost Considerations
**Tuition & Fees:** For a domestic Canadian student, UBC and Waterloo are dramatically cheaper than the U.S. options. UBC’s domestic tuition is about C\$6,000 per year, and with a C\$72,000 scholarship the user would essentially have a full ride. Waterloo’s tuition is higher (around C\$11k–18k/year for CS ) but still modest compared to U.S. universities; a C\$30k scholarship would significantly defray its costs. By contrast, as an international student at the U.S. schools, one faces ~\$80k USD per year (~C\$100k) in total costs. Harvard’s published cost for 2024 is about \$79,450 per year, and Princeton’s about \$86,700 if no aid is given. UC Berkeley (out-of-state) is similar: roughly \$54k tuition + \$25–30k living = ~\$80k/year. Carnegie Mellon is private and on par, around \$85–90k/year total. In sum, a four-year degree at the U.S. schools could cost **4–5 times** more out-of-pocket than UBC/Waterloo for this student.

**Scholarships & Aid:** UBC’s C\$72k award covers virtually all expenses, making it **the cheapest option by far**. Waterloo’s ~C\$30k scholarship might cover about one year of tuition, leaving perhaps C\$70k+ for the remainder – however, Waterloo’s co-op earnings often offset a large portion of that. The U.S. schools did not offer significant aid in this scenario, so one would likely be paying full sticker price (although Harvard/Princeton do offer need-based aid generally, here we assume none). That means potentially \$320k USD over 4 years, possibly financed via family funds or substantial loans. This stark contrast in cost will directly affect debt and financial stress after graduation.

**Total 4-Year Cost (approx):** UBC: ~\$0 (scholarship covers ~C\$72k); Waterloo: maybe C\$100k minus co-op earnings and scholarship (many Waterloo students earn ~\$15k per co-op term, which can cover a lot of tuition). Berkeley/CMU/Princeton/Harvard: on the order of \$300k+ USD (C\$400k). Even with savings or summer jobs, the gap is huge.  

**Ranking (Cost – 1=most affordable):**
1. **UBC** – With a full-ride scholarship, virtually no cost.
2. **Waterloo** – Low domestic tuition + C\$30k award + paid co-op jobs to offset costs.
3. **Harvard** – ~\$80k/year; ~C\$400k total if no aid. (Has generous aid for some, but not in this case.)
4. **UC Berkeley** – ~\$80k/year for non-residents ; high living costs in Bay Area.
5. **Princeton** – ~\$85k/year; similar to Harvard but slightly higher recent tuition.
6. **Carnegie Mellon** – ~\$85–90k/year ; high cost and limited aid for internationals.

_(Harvard vs. Princeton vs. Berkeley costs are all in the same ballpark – all very expensive – but Harvard/Princeton might edge Berkeley if any need-based aid were available. Here we rank them assuming full pay.)_

## **2. Long-Term Return on Investment (ROI)**
**Career Impact & Reputation:** All six schools are well-regarded, but in tech circles Berkeley, CMU, and Waterloo have especially strong CS reputations. Berkeley and CMU are perennial top CS programs, known to produce excellent engineers – employers highly value these grads. Waterloo, while less known to the general public, is _famous in the tech industry_ for its powerhouse co-op program and quality of grads. In fact, Waterloo is ranked 22nd globally for CS (QS Rankings) and has **nearly 5,000 CS undergrads**, far more than elite U.S. schools, feeding a large talent pipeline. Harvard and Princeton carry _prestige_ that opens doors in many fields – their name recognition and elite cachet can impress employers, though for pure CS/engineering roles, their programs are smaller. Still, Harvard CS grads are seen as top-notch generalists and often end up in leadership or interdisciplinary roles due to their broad education. Princeton is academically rigorous in CS (especially strong in theoretical CS); its grads are well-respected, though the school is not a large feeder to tech firms compared to the others.

**Alumni Network & Influence:** Harvard boasts an unparalleled global alumni network, including many influential figures in tech entrepreneurship and VC – that network can be leveraged 5–10 years out, especially if you aim for founding a startup or moving into management. Princeton’s alumni network is smaller but very distinguished; notably Jeff Bezos (Amazon’s founder) is a Princeton alum, reflecting the potential of its top graduates. Berkeley’s alumni network in Silicon Valley is **massive** – as a public school with a long history in tech, it has thousands of grads at Google, Apple, etc., and a strong culture of alumni startups in the Bay. CMU’s network is likewise strong in tech companies (especially in software, AI, robotics) and among technical leaders. Waterloo’s alumni network in Silicon Valley, though smaller in absolute numbers than Berkeley’s, is tight-knit – Waterloo grads actively help each other land jobs and even fund startups (the “Waterloo Mafia”). Many credit Waterloo’s co-op for creating a self-perpetuating cycle: grads enter big tech, then recruit more Waterloo students. UBC’s international alumni network is growing, but in Silicon Valley it’s not as prominent. UBC is highly respected in Canada and Asia, but a UBC grad may need to do a bit more to **prove themselves** in the U.S. compared to a grad from the other five.

**5–10 Years After Graduation:** In terms of career trajectory, a motivated student from any of these schools can reach the upper rankings of tech (senior engineer, startup founder, product manager, etc.) within a decade. However, the _on-ramp_ may be fastest from Berkeley, CMU, or Waterloo, where practical skills and industry exposure are baked in. Waterloo grads, for example, often have 2 years of work experience _upon graduation_ thanks to co-op, allowing them to “ascend the ranks…quickly” in the corporate ladder. Berkeley and CMU grads similarly are battle-tested by intense programs and internships; they’re heavily recruited and can hit the ground running. Harvard and Princeton grads might take a more varied path – some go straight into software careers, but others might pursue grad school, or pivot to product management, consulting, or founding companies. Their ROI in terms of _income_ may not be immediately as high if they choose academia or lower-paying sectors, but their broad skills and networks can yield big returns in leadership roles later. Importantly, Harvard’s brand can confer long-term advantages beyond the first job – e.g. easier access to venture capital or credibility when starting a business, given the “Harvard halo.”

**Entrepreneurship ROI:** If we consider entrepreneurial outcomes as part of ROI, Harvard and Berkeley have produced numerous successful startup founders (Harvard counts Microsoft’s Bill Gates and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg – albeit both dropped out – among its attendees, and Berkeley has a litany of tech founders). Waterloo is _exceptional_ in Canada for entrepreneurship – **18% of all Canadian tech founders are Waterloo alumni**, a testament to its startup culture and incubators. Princeton’s ROI in entrepreneurship is highlighted by Bezos and others, but the overall number of founders is lower. CMU has spawned startups (especially in AI/robotics), though many of its top grads join established firms or research labs instead. UBC’s entrepreneurial ROI is improving (UBC grads have founded companies like _Dapper Labs_ and _Hootsuite_), but it’s not yet a major startup factory on the level of the others.

In pure _financial ROI_ (income earned vs. cost of degree), **Waterloo likely wins** – its grads land lucrative jobs comparable to U.S. grads, but without the six-figure debt. UBC is similar low cost, but slightly fewer grads make it to the highest-paying U.S. jobs, so the income side may lag. The U.S. schools have outstanding career outcomes, but the high upfront cost eats into the ROI. Nonetheless, if one leverages the prestige of Harvard/Princeton to rise into executive roles, the long-term payoff can be enormous (think of Harvard alumni leading major tech companies or raising millions in funding – that kind of ROI goes beyond salary).

**Ranking (Long-Term ROI for career in tech, balancing reputation and cost):**

1. **Waterloo** – _High placement + low cost = superb ROI_. Renowned in tech (especially Silicon Valley) and huge co-op-fueled career boost.
2. **UC Berkeley** – _Top-tier CS reputation and deep Bay Area ties._ Expensive, but payoff is strong with so many grads at big tech and startups (network effects).
3. **Carnegie Mellon** – _Elite CS program_, virtually guarantees a high-paying tech career. High cost, but 5–10 years out many alumni are lead engineers or researchers at top firms.
4. **Harvard** – _Unmatched brand and network._ CS grads can leverage the Harvard name to transition into leadership or entrepreneurship, yielding long-term gains (despite the initial cost).
5. **Princeton** – _Prestige and rigor._ Smaller tech footprint than Harvard, but still excellent outcomes. The Princeton name carries weight, though its ROI is slightly less in pure tech due to fewer grads in the field.
6. **UBC** – _Low cost and solid education,_ but global tech reputation is not as strong. ROI is still good (little debt, decent job prospects), just not as supercharged as the others for Silicon Valley trajectories.

## **3. Employment Rates in San Francisco (Bay Area Placement)**
**Pipeline to Silicon Valley:** Being in or near California, UC Berkeley has a _huge advantage_. It’s located in the Bay Area itself, and a **very large percentage** of its CS graduates end up working in Silicon Valley. Employers swarm Berkeley’s campus – it’s routinely the #1 source of Silicon Valley tech hires. For example, one analysis found Berkeley was the **top university** for placement at tech firms in Silicon Valley, outpacing even Stanford. **Carnegie Mellon** is also a major feeder: CMU was ranked #3 in that same ranking, reflecting how many CMU grads move west to companies like Google, Apple, Meta, etc. **Waterloo**, notably, was the only non-U.S. school in the top 25 feeders to Silicon Valley (ranked around #16). Waterloo’s co-op program effectively channels students into Bay Area internships; by graduation many have full-time offers in California. In fact, it’s common to hear that _80%+ of Waterloo Software Engineering grads_ head to the U.S. (mostly Bay Area and Seattle) – a brain drain enabled by co-op connections and sought-after skills. Waterloo is often dubbed “Silicon Valley’s Canadian feeder school”.

**On-Campus Recruiting:** Waterloo sees all the big U.S. tech firms (Google, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, etc.) recruiting co-ops on campus, and these often convert to SF job offers. Berkeley’s career fairs are swarming with Bay Area company recruiters (given it’s next door). CMU, while in Pittsburgh, has every major West Coast tech firm eagerly recruiting its students; many grads end up in California despite the distance. **Harvard and Princeton**, on the other hand, do not send as high a proportion of their CS grads to California. They have more geographically diverse outcomes – some grads go to NYC or Boston tech companies, finance, grad school, etc. None of the Ivy League schools cracked the top 10 Silicon Valley feeder list, and in a recent hiring analysis, _no Ivy besides Cornell was even in the top 15_ for SV tech placement. That said, many Harvard CS students _do_ head West for internships and jobs; Silicon Valley companies certainly recruit there too. It’s just that the **absolute numbers** are smaller (Harvard’s CS graduating class is maybe ~100, versus Berkeley’s several hundred), and some Harvard/Princeton grads choose other paths. **UBC** has the lowest Bay Area placement rate of the six. While UBC produces strong CS grads, a majority stay in Canada (Vancouver or Toronto) or go to Seattle (Microsoft, Amazon in the Pacific Northwest). Only a small fraction manage to land jobs in Silicon Valley right out of undergrad – it’s not impossible, but U.S. visa hurdles and fewer direct recruiter pipelines make it less common.

**Career Services & Connections:** Waterloo’s co-op office is essentially a placement machine – they have established relationships with Bay Area companies and even organize events in Silicon Valley for co-op students. Berkeley’s proximity enables things like local tech mixers, semester-time internships, and an alumni mentor network in SF. CMU’s Career Center reports very high placement rates, with West Coast tech being a top destination for CS majors. Harvard/Princeton have excellent career services in general, but the focus is broader (including finance, consulting, academia). Tech giants do recruit on those campuses, but the volume of hires into SF is lower. For example, looking at alumni at Google: Berkeley and CMU each had **2–3 times more alumni at Google** than Harvard or Princeton in one analysis. Waterloo, while much smaller than Berkeley, still had almost 420 alumni at Google (as of 2014) – a notable presence. UBC did not appear in those top 20 lists for Google/Facebook hiring.

In summary, **Berkeley is the clear leader** for funneling students directly into Bay Area jobs (it’s local, large, and highly regarded). CMU and Waterloo are next, having strong pipelines despite their location. Harvard and Princeton see a decent share of their CS grads in Silicon Valley, but not at the scale of the others. UBC is the most limited in this regard.

**Ranking (Bay Area job placement success):**

1. **UC Berkeley** – Huge pipeline to SF; local advantage and top tech employer presence.
2. **Waterloo** – A _close second_. Through co-ops, a large portion of grads end up in Silicon Valley.
3. **Carnegie Mellon** – Many CMU CS grads move to CA; CMU is heavily recruited by West Coast firms.
4. **Harvard** – Some grads to SF, but many also choose East Coast or other paths. Lower volume to tech firms than above.
5. **Princeton** – Similar to Harvard; a handful of standout placements (e.g. to Google, Microsoft) each year, but smaller scale.
6. **UBC** – Few direct SF placements relative to others. Most grads stay in Canada or need extra effort to break into U.S. roles.

## **4. Co-op and Internship Opportunities**
**Structured Work Programs:** **Waterloo is unrivaled here** – it has the largest co-op program in North America. CS students at Waterloo typically alternate study terms with **4–6 co-op work terms**, graduating in ~5 years with up to 2 years of paid work experience. These are often high-quality internships at major tech companies (many students do at least one Silicon Valley co-op). The system is highly structured: Waterloo has a dedicated co-op job portal and interview process, making it almost guaranteed that a student will get multiple internships. This means by graduation, Waterloo students not only have strong resumes but also industry contacts; they often convert a final co-op into a full-time job offer. No other school in this list has such a built-in, pervasive co-op program.

The U.S. schools rely on summer internships (and sometimes research or startup work during the semester). **Berkeley** benefits from its location – students can intern at Bay Area startups during the school year or do part-time projects, and almost all CS majors land summer internships at top companies by junior year. There isn’t a formal co-op program, but the culture encourages tech internships (e.g. many Berkeley students will have 2-3 summer internships on their CV). **CMU** similarly doesn’t require co-op, but its CS students are in high demand for internships; by senior year most have interned at places like Google, Apple, or Microsoft. Some CMU students take a semester off for a longer co-op, but it’s case-by-case. **Harvard and Princeton** have more traditional academic calendars with summers free. Students certainly get internships – often through on-campus recruiting or their own networking. By virtue of their prestige, Harvard/Princeton can open doors: a motivated student can secure internships at big tech firms (and some do internships at Silicon Valley startups via alumni connections). However, internships aren’t _integrated_ into the curriculum as at Waterloo. It’s notable that at Harvard/Princeton a chunk of CS students might choose research positions or finance internships instead of pure software internships, depending on interests.

**Support & Outcomes:** Waterloo’s co-op office provides extensive support – resume workshops, coordinated interview rounds, and a vast employer network. This often results in **6 different internship experiences** (e.g. a term at a startup, a term at Google, etc.), giving breadth of experience. By contrast, Berkeley has career services and student tech clubs that help peers find internships, but it’s more student-driven. Berkeley’s advantage is the ease of **access to companies** – you can take a 30-minute BART ride to San Francisco for an interview or meet recruiters who visit campus weekly. Harvard/Princeton have smaller CS cohorts, so one might get more individualized help from professors or alumni for internship leads, but one has to be proactive. CMU’s career center actually hosts **“West Coast Networking”** trips and has strong ties to big tech recruiters, given CMU’s reputation; internships are plentiful (CMU reports ~95% of CS students have at least one internship).

**Quantity and Quality of Internships:** By graduation, a Waterloo student might have 4-6 work experiences (which is exceptional), a Berkeley or CMU student perhaps 2-3 (summers plus maybe a semester internship), a Harvard/Princeton student typically 2 (sophomore and junior summer). **UBC** does offer an optional co-op program for CS, but it’s not mandatory and not every student is in it. Those who enroll can do 3-4 work terms, similar in concept to Waterloo but smaller scale. However, UBC’s co-op placements are often in Canadian industry (local Vancouver or Toronto companies, or Seattle offices); getting a Silicon Valley internship from UBC is trickier but can happen for top students (requires securing a U.S. work visa for the co-op term, which some do manage via J-1 visas). The support at UBC exists but isn’t as extensive as Waterloo’s. Without co-op, a UBC student would aim for the usual summer internships – which can be competitive without the same level of campus recruitment as the others.

Overall, **Waterloo is the gold standard** for structured co-ops and multiple internships. Berkeley and CMU excel in internships through strong recruiting and student initiative. Harvard and Princeton students land great internships too, but opportunities may not be as automatically provided – students often need to network (though the Harvard name can make that easier once they reach out). UBC lags slightly due to fewer U.S. connections, unless one proactively joins co-op and leverages it.

**Ranking (Internship/Co-op opportunities):**
1. **Waterloo** – _Exceptional co-op program._ 4-6 paid work terms, built-in structure, top companies year-round.
2. **UC Berkeley** – _Internship-rich environment._ Easy access to Bay Area internships; strong summer internship culture.
3. **Carnegie Mellon** – _High internship placement._ Almost all CS students get top-tier internships (mostly in summers).
4. **Harvard** – _Great internships available,_ but must be self-driven. Name helps in landing opportunities, though not a formal co-op system.
5. **Princeton** – _Strong academics-to-internship pipeline,_ but smaller scale; students secure internships, though the school’s focus is more academic during terms.
6. **UBC** – _Optional co-op exists_ (for those who opt in, opportunities are decent, often in Canada). Otherwise, fewer on-campus recruiting opportunities for internships, especially in SF.

## **5. Research Opportunities and Faculty Expertise**

**Undergraduate Research Access:** Smaller elite schools like **Princeton** and **Harvard** shine in giving undergrads access to research. Princeton strongly encourages independent work – CS AB students do a junior project and a mandatory senior thesis, often one-on-one with faculty. This means by design every Princeton CS major engages in research or advanced development, which is rare elsewhere. Faculty at Princeton are very accessible; undergrads can often find research assistant (RA) positions during the year. Harvard, despite a relatively small CS department, has ample research opportunities too – professors often take undergrads into their labs, and there are programs like the Harvard College Research Program to fund undergrad research. Harvard’s new SEAS (engineering school) has been expanding, with big hires in AI and bioinformatics, so undergrads can work on cutting-edge projects (for example, Harvard undergrads have co-authored papers in machine learning and systems). The **faculty expertise** at Harvard/Princeton is world-class (though the departments are smaller): Princeton is renowned in theoretical CS, cryptography, and has notable AI faculty; Harvard has luminaries in AI (e.g. historically, Marvin Minsky started AI research at Harvard before MIT) and is investing in data science and computational neuroscience.

**Large Research Powerhouses:** **UC Berkeley** and **CMU** have _massive research enterprises_. Berkeley’s EECS department is consistently top-ranked in many fields – artificial intelligence, robotics, databases, computer architecture, etc. Undergrads at Berkeley can get involved via the URAP program or by directly contacting professors, but it requires more initiative simply because of scale. There are thousands of CS undergrads, so not everyone can easily get a research spot. The motivated top students, however, do join labs (e.g. the Berkeley AI Research lab (BAIR) has undergrads contributing to robotics and deep learning research). Berkeley also has an honors thesis option for undergrads. **CMU** is similarly prolific: areas like artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, programming languages, and robotics at CMU are arguably the best in the world. CMU does emphasize undergraduate research through programs like “Senior Research Thesis” and summer fellowships. Given CMU’s elite status, undergrads might rub shoulders with faculty who are pioneers (for instance, CMU faculty have been Turing Award winners and founders of entire subfields). A willing student can absolutely get involved – though CMU’s workload is heavy, those who want research experience can find it, especially by junior/senior year.

**Waterloo and UBC:** These are large universities with active research, but the undergraduate culture is a bit more pre-professional (especially at Waterloo). Waterloo has top-notch faculty in areas like computer security, cryptography, and human-computer interaction. It even has a school named for _David Cheriton_ (a billionaire computer scientist who is both a UBC undergrad alum and Waterloo PhD alum). Undergrads can pursue an honors thesis or work as research assistants, but relatively fewer do so compared to pursuing co-ops. The focus at Waterloo leans more toward industry experience than academic research at the undergrad level. Still, for those interested, opportunities exist – for example, Waterloo has the **Artificial Intelligence Institute** and the **Quantum Computing** hub (Institute for Quantum Computing) where undergrads can get involved. **UBC** has a sizable CS department with research in computer graphics, AI, and networking. Being a large public school, UBC offers an array of research labs (and Vancouver has growing AI research presence). Undergrads at UBC can opt for a Co-op in research or volunteer in labs, and top students might do an undergraduate thesis project. However, like other big schools, it’s on the student to seek these out; classes are large, so you might need to stand out. UBC’s faculty are strong (not as famous as MIT/CMU’s, but competent researchers). If a student proactively reaches out, they can find research work, especially in later years.

**Faculty Expertise Highlights:**

• **AI and ML:** CMU and Berkeley are powerhouses (CMU has historically dominated robotics and machine learning; Berkeley’s AI lab is leading in deep learning research). Princeton and Harvard have notable AI researchers as well (e.g. Princeton’s ORFE department intersects with ML, Harvard has an Embedded Ethics in AI initiative, etc.), but the scale is smaller. Waterloo has AI and data systems research (the “WatAI” institute), though arguably not as high-profile globally; UBC has emerging AI groups too.

• **Systems and Software Engineering:** Berkeley excels in systems (operating systems, databases – many innovations like BSD Unix and RAID storage came from Berkeley). CMU also is top in software engineering and programming languages (it basically invented the field of software engineering as an academic discipline). Waterloo’s faculty include leading software engineers and it’s strong in areas like compilers and formal methods (plus it’s known for hands-on software design via co-op). Princeton has a strong systems group for its size, and Harvard has some prominent systems professors (one example: Margo Seltzer was a well-known systems professor at Harvard, now at UBC actually).

• **Theory and Algorithms:** Princeton is historically strong here (it’s where algorithm genius Robert Tarjan taught, and where Turing Award winner Alonzo Church was a faculty member). Waterloo and UBC also have respected theoretical computer science groups (Waterloo’s C&O department is famous in combinatorics). Harvard has heavyweight theoretical CS names (like Leslie Valiant, a Turing Award winner in complexity theory). CMU and Berkeley, of course, are also excellent in theory.

• **Entrepreneurship and Innovation:** Many faculty at these schools have startup experience or actively encourage entrepreneurship – e.g. Berkeley’s faculty spun off companies like Databricks, and CMU faculty often commercialize their research in AI and self-driving cars (Aurora Innovation came from CMU robotics alumni/faculty). Harvard and Princeton faculty tend more toward pure research, but Harvard’s Paulson School has some “Professor-Entrepreneurs” especially in bio-tech and AI.

For an undergrad keen on research, **Princeton might offer the most intimate access** (small student-to-faculty ratio and a culture of undergrad independent work). **Harvard** is similar with strong funding for undergrad research. **CMU and Berkeley** offer unmatched breadth of research areas – any subfield you’re curious about, there’s a lab for it – but you may have to be proactive to join, given competition. **Waterloo** provides the option, but the onus is largely on the student to deviate from the co-op path and seek research experience (some do, especially if aiming for grad school). **UBC** has opportunities as well, but not as structured or celebrated as co-op or industry links.

**Ranking (Undergrad research opportunities & faculty prowess):**
1. **Princeton** – _Outstanding undergrad focus._ Mandatory senior thesis means guaranteed research experience; top faculty in theory and systems engage closely with undergrads.
2. **Harvard** – _Small program, big research._ Easy for undergrads to do research with star faculty; well-funded projects in AI, theory, etc.
3. **Carnegie Mellon** – _Research powerhouse._ Huge range of cutting-edge projects; motivated undergrads can plug into world-class labs (though must seek them out).
4. **UC Berkeley** – _Top in almost every research area._ Many opportunities but also many students – the ambitious will find a spot in its famed labs (AI, robotics, etc.).
5. **Waterloo** – _Strong faculty, fewer undergrad researchers._ Opportunities exist, but most students prioritize co-op over research; those who do engage in research find quality mentors (especially in math, cryptography, and human-computer interaction).
6. **UBC** – _Active research university_, but undergrad involvement is not as institutionalized. A proactive student can get involved, but it’s a large department so it requires initiative.

## **6. Top 25% Alumni Achievements and Roles**

**Notable Alumni & Entrepreneurs:** All these schools have impressive alumni, but there are differences in _who_ they produce at the very top end. **Harvard** has an edge in sheer star power – even though Gates and Zuckerberg didn’t graduate, Harvard was their springboard. Harvard can count **Bill Gates** (Microsoft founder; attended Harvard), **Mark Zuckerberg** (Facebook founder; attended Harvard) as part of its lore, along with alumni like **Sheryl Sandberg** (Harvard BA; former COO of Facebook) and **Steve Ballmer** (Harvard BA; former Microsoft CEO). Harvard’s top quartile of alumni includes many tech CEOs, startup founders, and venture capitalists, as well as researchers (e.g. **Dennis Ritchie**, co-inventor of C language, was a Harvard alum ). In big tech and entrepreneurship, the Harvard name repeatedly appears at the leadership level – even if some left early, the network and brand helped them.

**Princeton**’s standout tech alumnus is **Jeff Bezos**, who graduated from Princeton in Electrical Engineering. He’s one of the most successful entrepreneurs on the planet, which alone gives Princeton serious bragging rights. Other Princeton tech/business leaders include **Eric Schmidt** (former Google CEO – Princeton undergrad, Berkeley PhD) and **Meg Whitman** (Princeton BA; former CEO of eBay/HP). Princeton also has a history of alumni in research and academia who later led innovation (for instance, **Alan Turing** studied briefly at Princeton for his PhD). The top 25% of Princeton CS/engineering alumni often end up either founding companies or becoming top researchers or Wall Street quants – a Princeton degree is a common trait among a few tech unicorn founders and many high-level finance tech leads.

**UC Berkeley** has an enormous alumni base, so its top achievers list is long. In terms of entrepreneurship: **Steve Wozniak** (co-founder of Apple) is a Berkeley alumnus; **Eric Yuan** (founder of Zoom) got his graduate degree at Berkeley. Many pioneers of computing are Berkeley alumni: **Ken Thompson** (co-creator of UNIX) did his undergrad at Berkeley. Additionally, Berkeley alumni have founded or led companies like Sun Microsystems (co-founder Bill Joy took his M.S. at Berkeley), Intel (Gordon Moore got his PhD at Cal), and Tesla’s CTO **JB Straubel** is a Berkeley alum. Berkeley’s top quartile also populate the ranks of **chief engineers and CTOs** in Silicon Valley – for example, **Google’s workforce and leadership includes 1,600+ Cal alumni**, some of whom rise to director or VP levels. Berkeley’s combination of volume and quality means its alumni have a big footprint: a significant number of **Silicon Valley’s tech leaders** have a Berkeley connection.

**Carnegie Mellon** has produced many distinguished tech alumni, though some are less publicly famous and more known within tech circles. Examples: **Andy Bechtolsheim** (co-founder of Sun Microsystems) did his PhD at CMU. The founders of **MongoDB** met at CMU. **Luis von Ahn**, who created Duolingo (and invented CAPTCHA), got his PhD and became faculty at CMU (though undergrad elsewhere). Many top engineers at Big Tech are CMU grads; the top 25% might include people like **Kirk McKusick** (Berkeley CS pioneer, interestingly did grad at CMU) or **Meredith Whittaker** (CSU? – skip that). Perhaps more relevant: CMU alumni are heavily represented among **Turing Award winners and tech inventors**. For instance, **Edmund Clarke** (Turing Award for model checking) was a longtime CMU professor/alum. In industry, CMU grads become senior architects of major products – e.g., the person who led Google’s TensorFlow team or Microsoft’s Azure AI division might well be a CMU alum. There may be fewer household-name CEOs from CMU undergrad, but many **CTOs and technical founders**. Also, CMU’s entertainment technology grads have impacted the gaming industry (e.g., senior engineers at Disney/Pixar etc.). Essentially, the top quartile of CMU alumni are leaders in engineering – they might not all be CEOs, but they are the tech visionaries behind the scenes at Fortune 500 companies.

**Waterloo**’s top alumni achievements are impressive in the tech sphere. Waterloo has produced **Mike Lazaridis** (founder of Blackberry), who although he dropped out, is closely associated with Waterloo and later donated to establish the Perimeter Institute. **Vitalik Buterin**, the founder of Ethereum (major cryptocurrency platform), attended Waterloo (left to pursue Ethereum). **Chamath Palihapitiya** (venture capitalist and early Facebook exec) is a Waterloo alum. Additionally, Waterloo’s alumni have founded numerous startups: **ApplyBoard** (a unicorn company in edtech) was founded by Waterloo grads, as was **Kik Interactive** (messaging app). The **Velocity** incubator at Waterloo helped launch companies like _Pebble (smartwatch)_ and _Maluuba (AI startup acquired by Microsoft)_. Many of the top 25% of Waterloo grads occupy senior engineering positions at FAANG companies – e.g., it’s common to find Waterloo alums as Google **Distinguished Engineers** or Microsoft **Partner Engineers**. However, fewer have reached the very top executive rung in U.S. big tech (partly because as non-Americans they might hit visa barriers or pursue startups instead). Still, Waterloo’s influence in tech entrepreneurship is strong; a notable stat is that nearly one-fifth of Canadian tech startup founders are Waterloo alumni. In Silicon Valley, the “Waterloo Mafia” includes folks who have made significant contributions (for example, **Steven Woods**, a Waterloo alum, became Google’s engineering site director in Canada and helped hire countless Waterloo grads into Google).

**UBC** has some noteworthy alumni in tech, though fewer globally famous ones. One prominent figure is **David Cheriton** – a UBC alumnus (B.Sc. from UBC) who went on to become a Stanford professor and an early Google investor; he’s now a billionaire and known as “the professor who funded Google”. Cheriton’s impact is huge (he’s also co-founded companies like Arista Networks), illustrating that UBC can lay the foundation for top-tier success. Other UBC-connected tech entrepreneurs include **Ryan Holmes** (founder of Hootsuite, a social media company) and **Allen Eaves** (founder of STEMCELL Technologies, in biotech). The top 25% of UBC CS alumni might include senior developers at Google, Amazon, Microsoft – especially in the Pacific Northwest – and a few startup founders in Vancouver’s growing tech scene. However, UBC hasn’t yet produced as many mega-scale tech moguls or unicorn startups as the others. Many of UBC’s most successful alumni are in diverse fields (medicine, academia, etc.), not exclusively in tech entrepreneurship.

In terms of alumni in **leadership roles**: Harvard and Princeton graduates often ascend to management and executive positions, even if they start as engineers. The Ivy league emphasis on broad skills can translate to more alumni becoming product managers, directors, or C-suite execs later on. Berkeley, CMU, and Waterloo alumni might initially stick to technical tracks, but given their talent, many also climb into principal engineer or engineering manager roles – and some transition to founding companies. Notably, the _feeder patterns_ differ: a Harvard alum might leverage an MBA or network to get into leadership, whereas a Waterloo alum might leverage a successful project or startup exit.

**Influence in Tech Entrepreneurship:** Harvard’s network has seeded many venture capital firms – Harvard alumni (or dropouts) have created Facebook, Microsoft, and influenced countless startups; there’s a strong **Harvard in Tech** alumni organization. Waterloo’s Velocity and alumni network have made it a **startup powerhouse in Canada**, and many grads go through Y Combinator or other accelerators, connecting to the U.S. startup ecosystem. Berkeley’s alumni have founded a myriad of startups (several YC companies each batch hail from Cal grads, plus older companies like SanDisk, VMware, and recently Databricks have Cal DNA). Princeton’s entrepreneurial culture is smaller, but a few big wins (Bezos, etc.) demonstrate high potential. CMU has seen alumni start companies like **Aurora** (self-driving cars), **Duolingo** (language learning), and others in AI and cybersecurity.

**Ranking (Top Alumni Success & Leadership):**
1. **Harvard** – _Global elite alumni._ Tech billionaires (Gates, Zuckerberg), numerous CEOs/C-suite in big tech (Sandberg, Ballmer, Wojcicki), and powerful alumni network in entrepreneurship and VC.
2. **Princeton** – _High-impact alumni._ Bezos alone is a game-changer; plus other CEOs (Schmidt, Whitman) and top researchers. Smaller alumni base, but very influential per capita.
3. **UC Berkeley** – _Lots of tech innovators._ Many founders/co-founders (Apple’s Wozniak, Sun Microsystems, etc.), and a huge number of alumni in leadership at Silicon Valley companies.
4. **Waterloo** – _Tech entrepreneur pipeline._ Notable founders (BlackBerry, Ethereum ) and a constant stream of startup successes. Top alumni are tech leaders, though more in engineering roles than public-facing CEOs so far.
5. **Carnegie Mellon** – _Technical leadership._ Top alumni include tech pioneers and some founders (Duolingo, etc.), and many have risen to senior engineering leadership in FAANG. Fewer famous CEOs, but strong influence in the tech industry’s innovation.
6. **UBC** – _Some exceptional cases_ (Cheriton, etc.), but relatively fewer big-name tech founders/executives. Top UBC alumni in tech are often behind-the-scenes influencers or Canada-focused tech leaders.

## **7. Salaries of Graduates in the Field**
**Starting Salaries:** For software engineering roles, graduates from all these universities tend to command similar starting salaries when placed at major tech companies – because big firms have standardized pay. Generally, new grad software engineers at top Silicon Valley companies (Google, Meta, Apple, etc.) earn around **\$110k–\$130k USD base**, plus bonuses and stock that often bring the first-year total to ~\$150k. Since most grads from Berkeley, CMU, Waterloo, Harvard, and Princeton who go into tech will land at these kinds of companies or high-paying finance firms, their **median starting salaries** cluster in the low six figures. For example, median starting pay for Harvard CS grads is around \$128,900, and for CMU CS grads about \$138,900 (reflecting many at top-tier employers). Berkeley’s CS graduates average in a similar range (around \$110k–\$120k base; some data suggests ~\$112k median for EECS). Waterloo’s outcomes bifurcate: those who go to the U.S. easily get the \$100k+ USD packages, while those who stay in Canada have lower salaries (maybe C\$70–90k, which is ~\$50–70k USD). Thus the **average** starting salary for Waterloo CS grads might be slightly lower if you include the Canadian placements, but the **top quartile** (who go to Silicon Valley or NYC finance) make equivalent or higher salaries than their U.S. counterparts. In fact, Waterloo’s top students often secure U.S. offers at or above market rates – many negotiate offers from multiple FAANG companies thanks to co-op experience.

**Top Quartile / Lucrative Pathways:** The top 25% of graduates – those who either join high-paying sectors or quickly move up – can earn exceptionally high salaries early on. Ivy League CS grads sometimes go into quantitative finance or trading firms that pay **massive compensation**. It’s not unheard of for a Harvard or Princeton CS graduate to start as a quant trader at \$200k+ or a hedge fund engineer with significant bonuses. In fact, U.S. Department of Education data (College Scorecard) showed Harvard CS majors had the **highest median earnings four years after graduation at ~\$256,000** per year, with CMU CS not far behind at ~\$247k (and likely Princeton in that top group as well). These figures indicate that a significant chunk of those grads went into Wall Street or very senior tech positions within just a few years. Similarly, some top Berkeley and CMU grads who join fast-growing startups might see big equity gains that boost their effective earnings if the startup IPOs.

**Mid-Career Salaries:**  Five to ten years out, graduates from all these schools often move into senior engineer or manager roles, especially if in Silicon Valley, which come with salaries in the mid to high six figures. For instance, many Silicon Valley engineers with ~5-7 years experience earn \$200k–\$300k (including stock options). Because the career trajectories can even out, **mid-career pay** tends to be high for all six school alumni in tech. A survey of alumni salaries (across industries) showed Harvard grads averaging ~\$195k and Waterloo grads ~\$190k in those who self-reported – essentially in the same ballpark, which underscores that _once you’re in the field_, the school name matters less than performance. CMU and Berkeley grads in tech similarly often cross the \$200k mark within a few years.

**Stock Options and Entrepreneurship:** One wild card in “salaries” is equity. Alumni who join startups early or found their own can become multimillionaires if the startup succeeds. Here, Harvard’s top quartile might have an edge in transitioning to founder roles that yield big equity outcomes (e.g. a Harvard alum founding the next Facebook). Waterloo and Berkeley alums also frequently join startups (or found them) – sometimes taking lower salary initially but with stock that could pay off. For example, a Berkeley alum was on the founding team of a unicorn startup and their equity became worth tens of millions. These outcomes skew the “top end” earnings in ways salary surveys may not capture.

**Loan Payoff Implications:** The high starting salaries from most of these programs make loan repayment feasible (we discuss that more in section 8), but it’s worth noting that within a couple of years, many grads are earning well into six figures, especially in California.

To compare **average starting salaries** more directly: If we exclude those not in tech, probably CMU has the highest median (because virtually all go into high-paying tech jobs). Berkeley is close behind (large portion in tech, some in slightly lower-paying startups or grad school). Princeton and Harvard have more variance – a chunk might go to grad school (earning stipends, not salaries) or public sector, which can pull down the _overall_ average; however, those who go to industry often have extremely high offers (especially Princeton, known to funnel some to quant finance). Waterloo’s overall average (including Canadian jobs) might be a bit lower than the U.S. schools’ overall average, but its _U.S.-bound graduates_ make equivalent salaries to peers. UBC likely has the lowest average simply because a higher proportion stay in Canada where salaries are lower; a fresh UBC grad at a Vancouver tech company might make C\$75k (about \$55k USD). Still, top UBC grads who get into FAANG will earn the same ~\$120k starting as any other FAANG hire.

**Ranking (Graduate salaries – considering median and top quartile):**
1. **Carnegie Mellon** – _Highest median tech salaries._ Nearly all grads in high-paying tech roles; many hit \$120k+ to start, and a strong pipeline into lucrative careers (data suggests CMU CS ~\$247k median at 4 years out).
2. **UC Berkeley** – _High starting and early-career pay._ Large numbers in FAANG jobs (~\$110–130k start) and some in lucrative startups; median and top quartile very high in Silicon Valley.
3. **Princeton** – _Polarized but very high for top earners._ Many grads go to extremely well-paid finance/tech roles (pushing the top quartile sky-high), though a few go academic which lowers median. Those aiming for money do extraordinarily well.
4. **Harvard** – _Similar to Princeton._ The average tech-bound Harvard CS grad starts around \$125k, and a sizable number choose elite finance/quant jobs with >\$150k compensation. Top 10% have phenomenal earnings (some >\$300k within a few years), but a larger portion may choose varied paths (startups, research) that pay less initially, so we place Harvard just slightly below Princeton on pure salary metrics.
5. **Waterloo** – _Strong salaries, especially in the U.S._ Graduates who move to California or Seattle get \$100k+ offers like peers. Overall median is diluted by those staying in Canada (where \$70k CAD is common starting), but the _earning potential_ for Waterloo grads is on par with top U.S. grads – many reach \$200k+ after a few years in Silicon Valley.
6. **UBC** – _Lowest salaries on average._ Still very good by general standards, but many start in Canada or smaller markets. A typical UBC CS grad might start around C\$65–75k in Vancouver (≈\$50–60k USD). Those who break into Silicon Valley do earn equal salaries to others, but they are fewer in number, so both median and top-quartile salary levels are a notch lower than the other schools.
## **8. Student Loan Repayment and Financial Burden**

**Debt Levels:** Given the cost scenarios, a UBC student with a full-ride will graduate _debt-free_. A Waterloo student might have minimal debt if co-op earnings and the partial scholarship cover most costs – some Waterloo students even graduate with savings, since co-op income can exceed tuition in some years. On the other hand, attending a U.S. school at full fare could easily mean \$200k+ USD in loans if the family can’t pay out of pocket. We’ll assume the worst-case where the student or family takes on significant loans for the expensive options.

**Salary-to-Debt Ratio:** All schools (except UBC, where debt = \$0) produce graduates with high salaries, so paying off loans is generally feasible within a few years of working in tech. But the speed and burden vary. If one had, say, \$250k USD in loans from Harvard/Princeton/CMU/Berkeley, a typical tech salary (\$120k) means after taxes and living expenses in SF (which are high), one might manage to put \$30k-\$40k per year toward loans. That could mean ~7-10 years to fully clear that debt – a significant portion of one’s 20s. However, if one’s salary jumps quickly (and it likely will in tech), or if one gets stock grants that appreciate, it could be faster. Some Ivy League grads who enter finance could pay loans even quicker (a \$150k–\$200k first-year comp allows maybe \$50k+ per year toward loans, clearing \$200k in ~4 years). Nonetheless, the **financial burden of large loans is non-trivial**, especially combined with Bay Area cost of living. Graduates may feel pressure to live frugally despite a “big” salary, as a large chunk might go to loan payments.

**Ease of Repayment:**
• **UBC:** With essentially no debt (thanks to the scholarship), a UBC grad can start saving or investing part of their salary from day one. This is a huge head start – any salary they earn is net gain, not servicing debt.

• **Waterloo:** Likely low debt. Many Waterloo co-op students pay tuition with co-op earnings term by term. If any small loan remains, the starting salary (even if working in Canada at C\$80k) can knock it out in a couple years. If they work in the U.S. at ~\$100k USD, they could pay off, say, \$30k of remaining loans in one year. Essentially, **Waterloo grads typically face minimal financial burden** after graduation, which gives them freedom to take risks (like joining a startup or pursuing grad school) without worrying about heavy loan payments.

• **U.S. Schools (Harvard/Princeton/CMU/Berkeley):** Assuming full loans, the burden is heavier. All four have similar costs, but one factor to consider is that Harvard and Princeton have **no-loan financial aid policies** for many students (Princeton reports ~89% of seniors graduate debt-free due to aid). In this case though, the user anticipated no major aid, meaning potentially a big loan. On a ~\$120k salary in California, one could comfortably pay maybe ~\$1,500–\$2,000 per month towards loans. That’s \$18k–\$24k a year. On a \$200k loan, even with low interest, that’s ~10 years. Of course, one could tighten budget and pay more aggressively, or refinance if income jumps. If the graduate ends up at a high-paying firm or gets promotions, they might increase payments and clear it in, say, 5–7 years. It’s doable, but it’s a significant post-college weight. There’s also an _opportunity cost_: money going to loans isn’t being invested or used to buy a house in those years.

• **Between the U.S. options:** There’s little difference in loan burden – all cost about the same. One nuance: Berkeley, being public, doesn’t meet full financial need for internationals, so indeed one might have to borrow the entire amount. Harvard and Princeton, if the student had applied for aid and qualified, could have reduced loans – but assuming not, they’re equal or slightly higher in cost. CMU often expects families to pay or students to take private loans; no built-in aid for internationals either. So the debt scenario is similarly tough for all four. However, **job prospects from each are strong enough** that virtually all grads can manage the standard 10-year loan payoff timeline while still living decently. Also, these grads might strategically work in the U.S. for higher pay to handle loans, rather than lower-paying regions.  

**Lifestyle During Repayment:** A grad with heavy loans might delay some purchases (e.g. buying a home) or feel constrained in taking career risks. For instance, a Harvard grad with no aid might feel compelled to take a Big Tech job with a stable high salary rather than join a risky startup, until loans are paid. In contrast, a Waterloo grad with no debt might be more free to join a startup immediately or even start their own venture, because there’s no debt pressure – this freedom can indirectly affect long-term outcomes (some might say having no debt encourages entrepreneurship). On the flip side, the Ivy/CMU grads’ high salaries can handle debt and still allow a decent life in California (especially if roommates and modest living to save money).

In summary, **UBC and Waterloo provide the easiest financial start** – little to no loan burden, so graduates keep what they earn. The U.S. schools can lead to much larger debt, but high tech salaries mitigate this – graduates can generally pay off loans within a decade or less. The key difference is how much of one’s early career income is swallowed by loan payments.

**Ranking (Financial burden & loan repayment ease):**
1. **UBC** – _Virtually no debt._ No burden – salary can go to living and saving immediately.
2. **Waterloo** – _Likely minimal debt._ Co-op earnings and lower tuition mean small or no loans, which are easy to pay off with a tech salary.
3. **Carnegie Mellon** – _High salary outcomes help offset big loans._ Still, a full-pay international would have heavy loans to service, but CMU grads’ strong earnings make payoff relatively faster (many hitting high-paying roles in a few years).
4. **UC Berkeley** – _High cost, good pay._ Bay Area salaries and possibly stock comp help, but loan payoff might take several years of disciplined effort. (Berkeley is ranked here assuming similar debt as privates, with no in-state discount for the user.)
5. **Princeton** – _High cost, high pay for many._ Those who go into high-paying jobs can manage loans, but if an alum chooses grad school or lower-paying work initially, loans can linger. (Princeton’s generous aid isn’t in play here, so we treat it as a heavy-debt scenario.)
6. **Harvard** – _High cost, varied pay paths._ Many will earn a lot and pay loans quickly, but some may choose less lucrative paths (startups, research) which could make loan repayment longer. Harvard is only last because without aid it’s equally costly, and not _quite_ as uniformly tech-focused in immediate pay as the others – however, it’s a close call.

_(In reality, Harvard and Princeton try to ensure most students don’t need huge loans – but given our assumption of no aid, they end up similar to or even slightly higher than the others in debt burden. All four U.S. schools are roughly tied in this dubious distinction.)_

## **9. Residences and Campus Life (Housing & Cost of Living)**

**Housing Guarantee and Quality:** **Harvard and Princeton** excel in undergraduate housing. Both **guarantee on-campus housing for all four years**, which means you don’t have to worry about finding accommodation in expensive cities. Harvard’s system places freshmen in the historic Harvard Yard dorms, then into one of 12 Houses for sophomore through senior year. The Houses are a defining aspect of Harvard life – each is a small community with its own dining hall, library, and traditions. Quality of Harvard housing is generally high: rooms range from cozy to palatial (some senior suites can be quite large by college standards), and while some Houses are a bit farther (the “River” houses vs “Quad”), all are maintained well. Being guaranteed housing means cost is predictable (it’s part of tuition/fees ~ \$12k/year for room ) and Cambridge’s high rent market doesn’t directly affect undergrads. Princeton similarly has residential colleges for underclassmen and then offers dormitories or college-affiliated housing for upperclassmen. Princeton’s dorms are known to be comfortable and community-oriented; about 98% of undergrads live on campus. Both schools integrate social life with residential life (Princeton’s eating clubs provide dining/social venues for juniors/seniors, often while still living in dorms). **Bottom line**: at Harvard and Princeton, you will have a place on campus all four years – no landlord hunting, and a strong campus community.

**Campus Housing vs Off-Campus:** **Carnegie Mellon** guarantees housing for the first year (and sometimes sophomores), but not all four. Many CMU students live on campus for 1-2 years and then move to off-campus apartments nearby. Pittsburgh, however, has a relatively low cost of living compared to Boston or Bay Area. Students renting off-campus near CMU find it fairly affordable – one might pay ~\$700–900/month for a room in a shared apartment, which is manageable on a student budget (and sometimes co-ops or internships can help cover that). CMU’s on-campus dorms are decent, though perhaps not as lavish as Princeton’s. There are modern dorms and some older ones; generally, they’re okay in comfort. Importantly, Pittsburgh’s housing market isn’t very competitive for students, so _ease of securing housing_ after the guaranteed period is good – lots of student-oriented apartments around. CMU also has a housing office to assist.

**Waterloo** guarantees first-year residence for all freshmen, but after that students typically arrange their own housing. Waterloo being a college town means _housing supply is built for students_ – there are many apartments and student condos around the campus (and in adjacent Kitchener). The cost is moderate: perhaps C\$600–800/month for a room in a student apartment. One complication is the co-op system: students are often away every other term for work, so they might do short leases or sublets. Fortunately, Waterloo’s student community has an established sublet exchange – students frequently sublet their rooms to others on opposite co-op cycles. It’s a bit of a puzzle each term, but it usually works out. The good news is housing isn’t in shortage; landlords in Waterloo are used to 4-month leases for co-ops. Quality-wise, some of the newer high-rise apartments are quite nice (ensuite bathrooms, etc.), while older houses can be more basic. Campus life in terms of residence after first year is more disjointed because friends might scatter due to co-op, but there are also **residence communities like University College residences** some students stay in beyond first year. Overall, Waterloo housing is relatively easy to secure and _cheap_, but the frequent moving can be a hassle.

**UBC** guarantees housing for first-year students and recently has started to guarantee it for **students in their first year coming from outside the local area** (and also guarantees for fourth-year if you’ve stayed previously, etc., but not for every student all four years). UBC’s Vancouver campus has a lot of residence beds (it’s one of the largest campus housing systems in North America), but demand still exceeds supply for upper years. After first year, students enter a lottery for on-campus housing each year. Many second-years end up living off-campus due to limited slots, or they commute from home if local. Off-campus housing in Vancouver is **expensive and competitive** – Vancouver has one of the highest housing costs in Canada. A shared apartment could run C\$900–1200 per month per person, and finding a convenient place near campus can be tough (UBC is somewhat isolated on a peninsula, so the nearest off-campus neighborhoods (Kitsilano, Point Grey) have high rents). The university has been building more residences (like Ponderosa Commons, Orchard Commons) which are quite modern and sought-after, and if you win the lottery, you could stay on campus in a nice studio or shared suite at perhaps C\$800–1000/month (subsidized vs market Vancouver rent). But not everyone gets that. Third- and fourth-years often face either long bus commutes from cheaper areas or paying a premium for nearby rentals. So **ease of securing housing** at UBC beyond year 1 is lower – it requires either luck or money. The quality of UBC housing itself is generally good (first-year dorms are typical dorms, newer upper-year apartments are great).

**Berkeley** has the most challenging housing situation of the group. It guarantees on-campus housing **only for freshman year** (and in some cases sophomores, but traditionally just first year). After that, students must find housing in the Berkeley area. The Bay Area’s housing costs are extremely high, and Berkeley is no exception. There is a notorious housing crunch: students often have to scramble to find apartments, share rooms, or join cooperative houses/fraternities, etc. Rent for a shared room in Berkeley might be \$1,000+ per month per person (a one-bedroom apartment can easily be \$2,500+ in Berkeley). Many students end up in overcrowded apartments or living farther from campus (in cheaper areas like El Cerrito or Oakland) and commuting. The competition each year is intense – you typically have to secure housing months in advance. Berkeley’s university housing does have some apartments for upperclassmen, but very limited capacity – most students won’t get a spot. The quality of off-campus housing varies: there are some new upscale buildings (with rents to match), but also many older, somewhat run-down student houses. Additionally, Berkeley has some safety concerns in certain neighborhoods and a significant homelessness issue in the area, which can affect how comfortable students feel off campus. All told, housing is one of the biggest stress points for Berkeley students outside academics. The cost of living (rent, food, etc.) in the Bay Area is highest among these options – even higher than Cambridge/Boston. So Berkeley ranks lowest in housing convenience: after the first year, you’re largely on your own in a pricey market.

**Cost of Living Differences:** For a student, day-to-day costs also matter. Pittsburgh (CMU) and Waterloo are quite affordable cities for food, entertainment, etc. Vancouver (UBC) and Cambridge (Harvard) are mid-to-high (Vancouver has high rent, but food can be moderate; Cambridge/Boston is expensive overall, though some student discounts mitigate costs). Princeton is in a small town in New Jersey – on-campus life is comprehensive, and the town is not cheap but students spend most time on campus with meals covered by dining plans, etc. Bay Area (Berkeley) is the most expensive: from rent to a burrito on Telegraph Ave, expect to pay more. But Berkeley students often learn to budget (e.g. cooking at co-ops, etc.).

**Overall Campus Life (Housing) Experience:** Harvard and Princeton provide a more **immersive campus community** via housing – living with classmates all four years fosters tight bonds and is convenient. Princeton’s collegiate gothic dorms and Harvard’s historic houses also add to the charm of college life. Waterloo and UBC, after first year, have a bit more of an independent living vibe – which some like (more freedom) but it can fragment the community. CMU has a mix: some community early on, then students living in neighborhoods nearby (but since many stay in Pittsburgh on the weekends, campus life remains active). Berkeley, because students disperse into the city, retains a vibrant campus culture (tons of student co-ops, Greek life, etc.), but also some commuter feel for those who live farther out – and dealing with landlords is a rite of passage.

**Ranking (Housing, cost of living, ease of getting accommodation):**
1. **Harvard** – _Guaranteed housing all 4 years_ _; excellent dorm communities._ No need to deal with off-campus market, which in Boston is costly.
2. **Princeton** – _Guaranteed housing all 4 years_ _; high-quality dorms._ Nearly all students live and eat on campus, very convenient and cohesive.
3. **Waterloo** – _Cheap and available off-campus housing._ After year 1, easy to find nearby apartments; cost of living is low. Co-op schedules require flexibility, but housing is designed around student needs.
4. **Carnegie Mellon** – _Affordable city, decent housing options._ After the first-year dorm, plenty of reasonable off-campus housing in Pittsburgh; cost of living won’t break the bank, and many students secure housing without trouble.
5. **UBC** – _Good housing if you can get it._ First year is fine, but after that housing is competitive. On-campus housing lottery is hit-or-miss; off-campus in Vancouver is expensive and can be stressful to find.
6. **UC Berkeley** – _Housing is a major headache._ Limited on-campus housing after freshman year and extremely pricey, competitive rental market. Students often face high rents, roommate crowding, or long commutes – the most challenging living situation of the six.

### **10. Campus Culture, Clubs, and Entrepreneurial Support**
**Entrepreneurial Ecosystem:** **Berkeley and Waterloo** stand out for their entrepreneurship culture among undergrads. Berkeley’s proximity to Silicon Valley fosters a vibrant startup scene on campus. There are numerous hackathons (the annual **CalHacks** is one of the largest student hackathons in the world), maker spaces like Jacobs Hall, and entrepreneurship programs such as **SkyDeck**, Berkeley’s accelerator that even undergrads can participate in. Berkeley students routinely launch startups – often with mentorship from faculty or alumni – and there are many student clubs focused on venture capital, product management, and founder skills. The Berkeley entrepreneurial network is intertwined with the Bay Area: venture capitalists frequently visit campus for pitch days; students can easily attend meetups or do part-time work at startups in SF. This means if you want to found a company or join an early-stage startup, Berkeley provides both the culture (lots of peers trying to do the same) and the connections (through its alumni and location).

**Waterloo** has a legendary startup culture as well, often dubbed the **“Velocity” effect.** **Velocity**, Waterloo’s on-campus incubator, offers resources, mentorship, and even free workspace for student startups. It has been the launchpad for many successful companies (ApplyBoard, Kik, Embark, etc.). Students at Waterloo interested in startups might live in the Velocity Residence, where they get support to work on their ideas. Hackathons are big at Waterloo too – **Hack the North** (held at Waterloo) is Canada’s largest hackathon, attracting students from all over. Waterloo’s culture encourages building and problem-solving; many students do side projects or startups during co-op breaks. There’s also a strong connection to Y Combinator (YC) – Waterloo is known as a top supplier of YC startup founders in recent years. The entrepreneurship culture is notable given Waterloo’s location is not a major city – the university has essentially created a startup hub in-house and leverages the Toronto-Waterloo Corridor’s growing tech ecosystem. Additionally, successful alumni often return to Waterloo to scout talent or invest (for example, Waterloo alumni at VC firms or tech companies often mentor students).

**Harvard** has historically been known more for producing bankers and consultants, but in the last decade it has placed a big emphasis on innovation and startups. Harvard’s **Innovation Labs (i-Lab)** is a university-wide resource where students (even undergrads) can form ventures, get coaching, and even seed funding. There’s an active **Harvard Entrepreneurs Society** and events like hackathons (e.g., Harvard hosts “HackHarvard”). The culture at Harvard for entrepreneurs benefits from the presence of Harvard Business School (MBA students often team up with undergrads on startup ideas) and the proximity to MIT. Many Harvard students interested in tech entrepreneurship cross-register for classes at MIT or attend MIT hackathons, effectively tapping into that scene as well. The **VC network** accessible at Harvard is strong – plenty of venture capitalists are Harvard alumni, and HBS itself runs new venture competitions. Harvard undergrads with a viable startup idea can attract significant attention (for instance, **Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook out of a Harvard dorm**; more recently, startups like **CourseMatch** or **Devoted Health** had Harvard founders). The House system also fosters connections – e.g., faculty Deans or alumni affiliates of houses might be industry leaders who can mentor students informally. Overall, Harvard’s entrepreneurial culture is on the rise, though it may not be as “in the water” for every student as it is at Berkeley or Waterloo.

**Princeton** has a more subdued entrepreneurship scene – the student body is smaller and the culture more academic. However, Princeton has made efforts: the **Keller Center** for Innovation offers entrepreneurship courses, mentorship, and an incubator program (eLab) for student startups over the summer. Princeton’s location is not in a tech hub, but the school organizes trips to NYC and SF for entrepreneurial networking. There are clubs like Princeton Entrepreneurship Club that run hackathons (Princeton’s hackathon, _HackPrinceton_, draws students from many schools). The vibe at Princeton is often described as more **“intellectual”** – students might lean toward research or theoretical pursuits – but those with a startup bent do get support, just perhaps fewer peers doing the same. One cultural aspect: Princeton’s upperclassmen social life revolves around **Eating Clubs** rather than entrepreneurship; it’s a more traditional collegiate social scene. Still, notable entrepreneurs have come from Princeton (beyond Bezos, there are founders of companies like **Thumbtack** and **SoulCycle** from Princeton), so the potential is there. The availability of VC or incubator linkages is more reliant on tapping the alumni network (Princeton alumni, though fewer in number, are very loyal and can open doors if approached).

**CMU** has a strong tech culture and increasing support for startups. Being in Pittsburgh, which is evolving into a tech hub (especially for robotics and AI), CMU helps students commercialize ideas through programs like **Project Olympus** (an incubator for students/faculty) and the Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship. There is a lively hackathon scene (TartanHacks is a big CMU hackathon) and many CS students participate in startup weekends or build indie projects. Robotics students often spin off companies (the self-driving car boom saw multiple CMU spinoffs). CMU’s culture traditionally was more about going deep into tech (joining research labs or big companies) rather than starting companies as undergrads. But that’s been changing – for instance, **Duolingo**, a high-profile startup, was co-founded by a CMU professor and a PhD student, and it maintains ties with campus (often hiring interns and grads). Undergrads at CMU are now more frequently pursuing startup paths or at least considering them. The presence of the business school (Tepper) also creates opportunities for cross-discipline startup teams. CMU also has an integrated design and arts culture (especially with the Entertainment Technology Center), which leads to creative tech projects (like game design startups). Overall, CMU’s support for entrepreneurship is solid and getting better, but the environment is still not as super-saturated with startup fever as Berkeley or Waterloo.

**UBC** has an evolving entrepreneurial scene. Vancouver’s tech ecosystem is smaller than Silicon Valley or Toronto, but it’s growing (with companies like Slack originating in Vancouver). UBC has initiatives like **entrepreneurship@UBC (e@UBC)**, which incubates student and alumni startups and provides mentorship and early funding. There’s also the **Creative Destruction Lab – West** hosted partly at UBC, which connects science/tech startups with mentors (though this is more for later-stage ventures, often graduate student or faculty-led). Undergrad clubs at UBC include a Technology Entrepreneurship Club and frequent hackathons (like **nwHacks** at UBC, which is Western Canada’s largest hackathon). The culture at UBC around startups is not as pronounced as at Waterloo; students interested in startups have resources but must seek them out – it’s not pervasive. The campus culture is a bit more balanced: students engage in many activities (sports, outdoors, Greek life, etc.) and the entrepreneurial subset is just one part of the whole. That said, UBC’s entrepreneurial support is improving and the university has produced startups in gaming, biotech, and cleantech. Vancouver also has some VC presence and UBC alumni in tech (e.g., **Ryan Holmes of Hootsuite** as mentioned). An aspiring founder at UBC can leverage the city’s inclination for innovation in areas like sustainability and gaming, plus UBC’s supportive programs. It may require more individual drive to tap networks beyond campus (for example, attending local meetups off-campus, since Vancouver’s tech meetups aren’t walking distance like Berkeley’s are).

**Clubs and Extracurriculars:** Outside entrepreneurship, all schools offer a plethora of clubs and activities. Harvard has 400+ student organizations ranging from debate to theater to robotics, and famous traditions like the Lampoon (humor magazine) and HackHarvard hackathon. Social life can include everything from final clubs (social clubs) to public service orgs. Princeton has its eating clubs (which are social/dining clubs juniors and seniors join – a unique social scene), as well as strong performing arts and athletics traditions (Princeton has a bit more of an insulated campus social life, with a work-hard, play-hard vibe). Berkeley, being huge, has every club imaginable – multiple coding clubs, consulting clubs, political orgs, cultural groups, Division I athletics (big sports culture, though not as dominant as at some state schools, it’s still present), and an activist spirit (protests and social causes are common on Sproul Plaza). Berkeley’s size means you can find a niche for any interest. CMU, smaller, has a tight-knit feel; students are known for being quirky and creative (the famous **“Buggy” races and **“Booth” competitions during Spring Carnival** are student engineering competitions that showcase CMU’s playful tech culture). CMU also has a strong arts scene due to its drama school – so a CS student can easily be involved in, say, a student improv troupe or game design club. Waterloo’s extracurriculars often revolve around tech (coding competitions, math contests) and niche hobbies (board game club, etc.), and because students rotate in and out on co-op, some clubs operate year-round with changing membership. Waterloo also hosts **quantitative finance clubs, design teams (like solar car team)**, and an eSports scene – in general, it’s a bit more of a no-frills environment socially, but students form communities through classes and residences. UBC’s campus life is vibrant: a wide range of clubs (from a large ski/snowboard club – given the proximity to mountains – to a stellar debate society, and plenty of cultural clubs). UBC has fraternities/sororities for those who want Greek life, and also a laid-back west-coast social atmosphere (beach parties at Wreck Beach, etc.).

**Entrepreneurial Culture Summary:** If your focus is specifically on **startup culture and support**, Berkeley and Waterloo rank highest – you will be surrounded by peers launching ventures and have structured help. Harvard is not far behind now, given its resources and network (and can be especially powerful if you leverage cross-enrollment with MIT). CMU and Princeton offer solid support but a smaller scene. UBC has some support but the culture is less oriented toward startups relative to the others.

  

**Ranking (Entrepreneurial culture & clubs):**
1. **UC Berkeley** – _Thriving startup culture._ Hackathons, accelerators (SkyDeck), and constant access to Bay Area VCs. Huge variety of clubs/hackathons; very easy to dive into entrepreneurship.
2. **Waterloo** – _Co-op + startup synergy._ Velocity incubator, Hack the North, and a community of builders. Students constantly create and innovate; strong ties to YC and Canadian VC.
3. **Harvard** – _Emerging tech entrepreneurship hub._ Backed by i-Lab and Harvard’s immense network. Cross-pollination with MIT and HBS spurs startups. Tons of clubs (from finance to drama) for a well-rounded campus life.
4. **Carnegie Mellon** – _Innovative tech culture._ Great for robotics/gaming startups; growing support via Project Olympus. Many interdisciplinary clubs; creative, techy vibe on campus.
5. **Princeton** – _Focused academic culture with pockets of innovation._ Good resources (Keller Center) but smaller entrepreneurial community. Rich traditional clubs and social life beyond startups.
6. **UBC** – _Increasing support but smaller scene._ e@UBC incubator available, and some hackathons, but not a dominant part of campus life. Lots of other extracurriculars and a balanced social scene.

## **11. Campus Diversity, Student Support Services, and Extracurriculars**

**Diversity:** All six universities value diversity, but the composition varies. **Harvard** and **Princeton** have extremely diverse student bodies in terms of geography, ethnicity, and background. As private Ivies with generous aid, they attract students from all over the U.S. and the world, across all socioeconomic groups. Harvard’s undergraduate population is around 14% international, 15% African American, 25% Asian American, 12% Hispanic, etc. Gender diversity is balanced (~50% women overall, and Harvard CS has been near 40% female in recent years after initiatives). Princeton similarly has a balanced mix and has been working to increase first-generation college students and lower-income representation (its recent no-loan aid helps). Both Harvard and Princeton have active offices of Diversity & Inclusion, cultural centers (e.g. Harvard has the Harvard Foundation, Princeton has various affinity group centers), and celebrate multiculturalism. On these campuses, you’ll encounter classmates from every state and many countries, which enriches discussions and the community.

**Berkeley** is very diverse in some ways and somewhat less in others. As a public California university, it has a large number of Asian and Asian-American students (over 40% of undergrads), a sizable Latinx population (~20%), but a smaller percentage of Black students (~3%). It’s socioeconomically diverse – many middle-class and working-class students attend Berkeley due to California’s public mission, and also a good number of first-gen college students. Berkeley also has a significant international student contingent (~15%+). Gender diversity in CS specifically at Berkeley has been improving (the intro CS course is nearly 50/50 male-female now, though the upper-level CS major is still more male, around 25-30% female). Berkeley’s scale means you find many communities: there are dozens of cultural clubs (e.g. Filipino Students Association, Black Engineering and Science Students Association, etc.) that create spaces for different identities. It’s known as a very welcoming campus for LGBTQ+ students as well. Politically, Berkeley is famous for its activism – students of diverse viewpoints debate and engage in causes (with a generally liberal tilt).

**Waterloo** historically had less gender and ethnic diversity in certain programs. Its CS and engineering programs in the past had a high concentration of students of Asian descent (both Canadian-born and international, particularly from China and India) – it’s not unusual for a CS class at Waterloo to be, say, 70% students of Asian heritage. This is partly a reflection of Canada’s demographics in the GTA and Vancouver (Waterloo draws many top students from these regions), and partly international recruitment. Other ethnic groups (Black, Indigenous) are underrepresented, though Waterloo has initiatives to improve that. Gender diversity in Waterloo CS/Engineering has been a challenge, but improvements are underway – for instance, women make up around 30% of the entering class in CS now (up from under 20% a decade ago). Waterloo has active Women in CS/Engineering groups to support female students. Socioeconomically, Waterloo has many middle-class students from Ontario but also international students (who pay high fees). Overall, the campus is quite international though not as globally mixed as Harvard. Culturally, Waterloo may not feel as _cosmopolitan_ as a big U.S. metro campus; it’s a bit homogeneous in terms of a large proportion of students being STEM-focused and from certain backgrounds. However, that also creates a sense of community among those groups. There are diversity offices (Waterloo has an Equity Office, supports for LGBTQ+, etc.), but the scale of support might not be as robust as at wealthier U.S. schools.

**UBC** is _highly international_. Vancouver is a multicultural city and UBC reflects that. A significant percentage of UBC undergrads are international (about 28%). You’ll hear many languages on campus – lots of students from China, India, Iran, the U.S., etc. Among domestic students, UBC draws heavily from the diverse population of British Columbia (especially Asian-Canadian communities). Ethnically, UBC likely has a majority Asian student population (including East Asian and South Asian heritage), with other groups represented as well. Gender-wise, across the whole university it’s roughly balanced, but in CS specifically UBC also faces the common imbalance (they have initiatives to encourage women in tech, similar to Waterloo). UBC has strong Indigenous student support (being on the west coast with a significant Indigenous population, they have dedicated services and an Indigenous residential community, etc.). Inclusivity is a focus – there are resource centers for different identities (Pride, ethnic centers, etc.). One thing to note: being a large public university, UBC can sometimes feel bureaucratic, and some students might feel like “just a number” if they don’t seek out communities – but the communities do exist and are welcoming.

**Support Services:**

• **Harvard and Princeton**: They offer extensive support. Academic advising is personalized (Princeton assigns every student a faculty adviser and also uses residential college advisers; Harvard assigns freshman advisers and then concentration advisers). Class sizes in freshman year can be large for intro courses, but sections and office hours ensure students get help. For personal support, these Ivies have _health and counseling centers with ample resources_ (e.g. Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services offers free therapy sessions, there are wellness workshops, etc.). Both have writing centers, tutoring programs (Harvard’s Bureau of Study Counsel, Princeton’s McGraw Center) – help is readily available if you seek it. There is also a strong sense of community via the residential systems, which means if a student is struggling, often a resident dean or peer adviser notices and helps. In terms of diversity support: Harvard has cultural proctors/tutors in houses focused on BIPOC student support, Princeton’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion runs mentoring for underrepresented students. Both have active mental health awareness campaigns (though high-pressure environments, they try to combat stigma of seeking help). Importantly, Princeton’s student body is smaller (around 5,000 undergrads to Harvard’s 6,700), which can mean more intimacy in support. Both campuses are quite safe, and resources like campus security, free late-night shuttles, etc., are present.

• **Berkeley**: As a large public school (~31k undergrads), support services are available but can be stretched. There is an advising system, but a CS major might have to be proactive to get advising in a timely manner given the ratio of students to advisers is high. Berkeley’s academic rigor can be intense and some students report difficulty accessing professors in huge lectures – but the university provides many _peer tutors and GSIs (grad student instructors)_ who hold office hours. For mental health, Berkeley has the Tang Center which offers counseling, but demand often exceeds supply; wait times for appointments can be an issue. In recent years Berkeley has expanded resources like 24/7 counseling hotlines and embedded counselors in some departments, but it’s still a known stress point. On the diversity/inclusion front, Berkeley’s diverse student body creates peer support networks organically. There are many student-led support groups (for first-gen students, for undocumented students, etc.) and resource centers like the Multicultural Center and Gender Equity Resource Center. Berkeley’s atmosphere encourages students to advocate for themselves – e.g., if mental health services are inadequate, students have spoken out, leading to improvements. Extracurricular support: Berkeley has countless clubs, and those can provide social support. It’s possible at Berkeley to find your niche (e.g. a cooperative living house, a religious group, a dance team) which becomes your “family” on campus. But one must be proactive; otherwise, it’s easy to feel anonymous in the crowd. Overall, support exists but _you need to seek it_ at Berkeley, whereas at Harvard/Princeton it might seek you (through their tight-knit residential system).

• **Waterloo**: Waterloo has solid academic support in terms of tutoring (the **Math Tutorial Centre** is famous for helping students grind through tough assignments, for instance). However, Waterloo is known for being quite rigorous and at times having a _sink-or-swim_ vibe. The co-op stresses (applying to jobs, moving every 4 months) can add to pressure. Mental health at Waterloo became a concern a few years ago; there were student protests about insufficient mental health resources following some student crises. Waterloo responded by enhancing counseling services (more counselors, a wellness center), but some students still feel the intensity. The university’s Wellness Office and student union (WUSA) provide support (like **Empower Me** counseling hotline ). There are also mentorship programs (upper-year mentors for first years, etc.). Class sizes in math/CS can be large, but professors and TAs have office hours. It might require student initiative to get help – but Waterloo students are often collaborative, forming study groups to survive tough courses. On diversity/inclusion: Waterloo has Women in Computer Science (WiCS) and Women in Engineering committees actively supporting female students via mentoring, networking, etc. They also have events for international students, and resources for LGBTQ+ (the Glow Centre, which is one of Canada’s oldest LGBTQ student orgs). Waterloo’s social environment is sometimes described as quieter (since a chunk of students leave for co-op at any time, campus population fluctuates, and there’s not as much of a party scene as larger universities). But there are extracurriculars: a decent music scene, clubs, sports intramurals. The smaller social scene can foster closer bonds within those who do partake. Students often hang out playing board games, video games, or in the dorm common rooms – a bit nerdy, but friendly.

• **UBC**: UBC offers a range of support services but, akin to Berkeley, you might have to be proactive in using them. There are academic advisers for each faculty (Science, Arts, etc.), though each adviser has many students to handle. UBC has a **learning center** that provides peer tutoring and workshops on study skills. For mental health, UBC has counseling services (free for students), but again wait times can vary. UBC has taken steps to promote wellness, like “Wellness Peers” and therapy dog events during exams. The campus being large, one challenge is finding community – but UBC’s plethora of clubs (350+ clubs) helps students connect with like-minded peers. If you join, say, the UBC Anime Club or the Ski Club, you instantly have a friend group, which acts as an informal support network. On diversity: UBC’s student population is very international and multicultural, so inclusivity is generally part of the culture. They have an Equity & Inclusion Office focusing on anti-discrimination and a range of cultural events (e.g., Lunar New Year celebrations on campus, Indigenous Awareness Week, etc.). For new international students, UBC has transition programs to help adjust (including English language support if needed). In terms of _student life_, UBC’s campus is known for being friendly but not as “all-consuming” as an American residential college – many students commute or go home on weekends if from the area, so one has to make an effort to engage. Residence life for those on campus fosters good community though. Extracurricular variety is excellent: from rowing on the creek, to student government (the AMS is active), to fraternities, to a huge **Thunderbird sports** culture (UBC is competitive in Canadian university sports). So socially and developmentally, a UBC student can be as active as they want.

**Inclusivity Initiatives:** Harvard and Princeton have been working on things like gender-neutral housing options, diversity training, etc. Berkeley likewise has gender-inclusive restrooms widely available and was a pioneer in accommodating students of all backgrounds (free speech movement legacy, etc.). Waterloo and UBC are also adapting – for example, Waterloo recently opened a new Student Service Centre to streamline support, and UBC has a Pride collective for LGBT students. None of these campuses is free of stress or challenges, but all have communities to help navigate them.

In general, **Harvard** might offer the best overall package of support due to resources (high staff-to-student ratio, lots of funding for student services, and a strong sense of community through the House system). **Princeton** similarly, with even smaller scale and a very nurturing undergrad focus (Princeton prides itself on being an undergraduate-focused Ivy). **Berkeley** and **UBC** offer breadth of experience and diversity but require more self-advocacy to get support – they foster independence. **CMU** falls somewhere in between: smaller, so more personal than Berkeley, but it has a rigorous culture (“Scotty Syndrome” of trying to do it all is a known phenomenon at CMU). However, CMU’s community of hardworking, somewhat quirky students can be very supportive of each other – “we’re all in this together” vibe. **Waterloo**’s co-op-driven schedule makes the community fractured at times, but it also means those on campus bond over the shared academic grind, and the university is aware of needing to support student wellness in a high-stress environment (efforts are ongoing).

**Ranking (Campus diversity, student support, overall extracurricular environment):**
1. **Harvard** – _Extremely diverse and well-supported._ Nearly every culture and identity is represented; strong financial aid fosters socioeconomic diversity. Robust mental health and academic support, tight residential communities, and endless extracurriculars provide a safety net and enrichment.
2. **Princeton** – _Diverse and intimate._ Similar to Harvard in commitment to diversity and inclusion. Very low student-to-faculty ratio, lots of personal attention and support. Active cultural clubs and a close-knit social life (residential colleges, eating clubs) create an inclusive community.
3. **UC Berkeley** – _Broad diversity and vibrant student life._ The student body is a mosaic of backgrounds – a true microcosm of California. Students find communities within the large campus. While you must seek support actively, the sheer number of groups means everyone can find their “home.” Strong advocacy culture also means students look out for each other.
4. **UBC** – _International and multicultural._ High global diversity, welcoming to international students. Good range of student services (though you may need to take initiative). Lots of clubs and a laid-back West Coast social vibe make it relatively easy to make friends and find support among peers.
5. **Carnegie Mellon** – _Collaborative and quirky._ Students often bond over workload and shared interests (gaming, arts, etc.). Decent support services and a community that, while small, is diverse (especially with many international and grad students on campus). Known to be demanding, but the presence of arts/design students adds social balance to the tech intensity.
6. **Waterloo** – _Focused community, improving diversity._ Very strong community among specific cohorts (e.g., your class, your co-op cohort), but overall campus can feel less culturally varied than others. Support exists but the intense academic/co-op culture can be taxing. Students tend to form tight friendships in first year and via co-op networks, which become their main support system. Waterloo is working on inclusivity, and you will certainly meet people from various countries in CS, but the overall campus cultural scene is more limited (it’s a STEM school without as much arts/humanities influence). On the flip side, students support each other through the challenging program, which creates camaraderie.

## **Overall Ranking and Recommendation**

Taking **all factors into account** – long-term ROI, cost, Bay Area job placement, internships, research, alumni outcomes, salary, debt, housing, culture, support – we weigh the priorities of _maximizing career outcomes in California (big tech or entrepreneurship)_ against the financial and personal factors. Here is a balanced overall ranking for this specific context:

**1. University of Waterloo:** **Waterloo emerges as a top choice** when considering ROI and career outcomes in tech. It offers an outstanding combination of **low cost and high payoff**. With almost no out-of-pocket cost (due to scholarships/co-op) and a program structured to give you up to two years of work experience, Waterloo sets you up for employment in Silicon Valley as well as any U.S. school – indeed, it’s a leading feeder to Bay Area tech. Employers know and respect Waterloo grads for their practical skills. The alumni network in big tech is strong (especially in engineering ranks at Google, Microsoft, etc.), and the school’s reputation among tech entrepreneurs is bolstered by success stories (from BlackBerry to a host of startups). While it may lack the prestige glamour of Harvard or the on-site Bay Area location of Berkeley, in terms of **“bang for buck” Waterloo is exceptional**. You’ll graduate debt-free with a resume loaded with internships – a combination that means you can take a job at Google or launch a startup without financial stress. The student life at Waterloo might not be as rich in liberal arts or social glamour, but the entrepreneurial spirit is alive and resources like Velocity support startup ambitions on campus. For a student whose goal is a career at a top Silicon Valley company or to found a startup – and who values avoiding huge debt – Waterloo offers the most efficient path. Its only downsides relative to others are a less renowned global brand and a heavier co-op workload, but these are outweighed by its advantages for this scenario.

**2. UC Berkeley:** **Berkeley is a close second** – it’s basically in the heart of the tech world and boasts a world-class CS program. If cost were not an issue, many would choose Berkeley for the sheer immersion in Silicon Valley culture and opportunities. Berkeley will maximally expose you to Bay Area recruiters, startup culture, and a top-notch CS education. It has the advantage of a strong academic reputation _and_ location – you can network with tech companies during the school year, attend meetups, and easily land multiple internships. Long-term, a Berkeley degree holds weight (especially in tech circles, sometimes on par with MIT/Stanford in esteem), and the alumni network in California is massive, helping with mentorship and job referrals. Berkeley also offers more traditional campus life and diversity than Waterloo – big sports, myriad clubs, etc., which can be a plus for personal growth. The big drawback is cost: as an international student, you’d be paying an exorbitant amount and likely incurring loans. The ROI is still solid because Berkeley grads do very well in their careers, but the debt burden would eat into those early earnings (hence it’s ranked just below Waterloo, which achieves similar career outcomes with a fraction of the cost). If the student highly values being in California from day one and can manage the finances, Berkeley might even be #1. But given our emphasis on ROI and cost, we place it #2.

**3. Carnegie Mellon University:** **CMU is third overall**, primarily because of its stellar academic reputation in CS and proven career outcomes. In pure tech education and recruitment, CMU is as good as it gets – many would argue it’s #1 in computer science rigor. Employers certainly know that a CMU CS grad is battle-tested, and CMU consistently places graduates into top roles (including West Coast jobs) at very high salaries. It also tops the charts in that feeder study and salary data. So why #3? Mainly cost and location. It carries the high tuition of a private U.S. university (with likely no aid), meaning big loans – similar to Harvard/Princeton in that regard. And its location, Pittsburgh, while up-and-coming, is not Silicon Valley; you’ll still get to Silicon Valley, but you won’t be _in_ the ecosystem during school like you would at Berkeley. Also, CMU’s culture, while rich in tech and interdisciplinary art, may not have as many broad opportunities as a larger school – it’s a bit intense and niche (which can be a positive or negative depending on the student). In terms of ROI, CMU grads earn at least as much as anyone, but you’re paying a lot upfront. Weighing that, CMU comes slightly behind Berkeley (since Berkeley gives the Bay Area advantage) but ahead of the Ivies because its focus aligns so directly with big tech careers and it has a _track record of funneling people to those jobs_. If one’s goal is purely to become a top engineer at Google or a researcher at OpenAI, CMU is a fantastic choice – the networks and skills you build there will serve you exceptionally well.

**4. Harvard University:** **Harvard takes fourth**, largely because of its unparalleled brand and network, which can translate into unique opportunities in tech and beyond. While Harvard’s CS program is smaller and not as industry-oriented as the above schools, a Harvard degree carries lifelong clout. If you have entrepreneurial aspirations, the Harvard name can open doors to investors and influential mentors that few other names can. Additionally, Harvard’s multidisciplinary environment means you’ll rub shoulders with future leaders in all fields – your roommate could be a future senator or startup CFO. This broad network can be a huge asset if, say, you start a company and need partnerships or hiring connections. In terms of direct tech career prep, Harvard CS will get you to the same places (Google, Facebook, etc.), but you might have to be a bit more self-driven in seeking internships (since the CS cohort is smaller and not all are gunning for FAANG – some might go to research or product management). The lack of structured co-op is mitigated by the ease of getting summer internships through the Harvard name. Cost is the main detractor – with no major aid, the ROI drops; you’d be paying a lot for the brand. However, the _long-term ROI_ could still be enormous – Harvard’s top alumni outcomes (CEOs, tech founders) show that down the line, the network and credibility can lead to high-impact careers (and high earnings – recall the stat about Harvard CS grads’ 4-year-out median being extremely high ). Student life at Harvard is extremely rich (perhaps the best overall college experience among these, with housing, clubs, support all top-notch). So if one values a well-rounded elite education and is thinking not just about the first tech job but also the possibility of launching a world-changing startup or moving into leadership, Harvard has a compelling case. We rank it below the more tech-specialized options only because the question prioritizes immediate tech career outcomes and ROI – areas where Harvard is excellent but not quite as optimized as Waterloo/Berkeley/CMU for a _software engineer pipeline_.

**5. Princeton University:** **Princeton is fifth**, by a small margin. In many ways, Princeton offers a similar elite pedigree to Harvard, with the bonus of an even more undergraduate-focused environment. Its CS program is strong academically, and Princeton’s overall reputation in math, engineering, and sciences is superb. For tech entrepreneurship, Princeton’s name is respected (and again, Bezos as an alum is a powerful testament to what a Princeton grad can do). The reason it falls below Harvard is mainly network scale and location – Harvard has more global name recognition and a larger, more active tech alumni base nowadays (partly due to Harvard’s larger size and perhaps more grads in tech industry roles). Princeton’s smaller community might mean fewer immediate tech networking connections (though the ones that exist are high-quality). Also, Princeton’s geographic isolation (New Jersey) means fewer spontaneous interactions with tech industry compared to Harvard (near Boston’s tech scene) or definitely compared to Berkeley. Cost is similarly high, with no initial aid assumed. Princeton’s ROI is still very high in the long run – its grads have stellar career trajectories, whether in tech, finance, or academia. The education is arguably the most intimate and rigorous among these (Princeton makes you do that senior thesis, which is a huge undertaking and great learning experience). For a student who prioritizes a **top-tier education and doesn’t mind a slightly smaller tech circle**, Princeton is fantastic. But for immediate Silicon Valley placement and co-op/internship volume, Princeton is a bit behind the others. It’s ranked just below Harvard because Harvard’s broader networks and proximity to MIT give it a slight edge for tech-minded students.

**6. University of British Columbia (UBC):** **UBC comes in sixth** not because it’s a bad choice – it’s actually an excellent school – but in this very competitive set and with the specific focus on California tech outcomes, UBC is at a disadvantage. Its pros: lowest cost (tied with Waterloo for affordability, in this case full-ride), a solid CS education, and a great college experience in beautiful Vancouver. For someone who wants minimal debt and a good education, UBC is fantastic. However, when it comes to _breaking into Silicon Valley or big tech_, UBC is less of a launchpad than the others. Fewer Silicon Valley companies recruit directly at UBC, and you might need to plan for additional steps (perhaps doing a Master’s in the U.S., or spending extra effort on U.S. job applications) to land in SF. It’s certainly possible to go from UBC to a Bay Area job – many have – but you won’t have the same volume of peers doing it or alumni at those firms to referral you in, compared to Waterloo or Berkeley. UBC can be a smart ROI play if one is content to work in Canada (where the tech scene is growing, and you’d still do well financially especially without loans). But since the question specifically emphasizes California outcomes, UBC ranks lower. The long-term career impact of UBC is strong in general but more regional; its alumni network in Silicon Valley is the smallest here. That said, UBC does provide a well-rounded college life – arguably more laid-back and enjoyable day-to-day than some intense U.S. schools – which could be valuable for personal development and mental health. In summary, UBC is the safe, inexpensive bet, but for maximizing _California big tech success_, it’s not as accelerated a track as the others. One might need to be a top student at UBC and really hustle to get the same opportunities that would come more easily at the higher-ranked schools.

**Final Thoughts:** All six of these institutions are excellent and will set you up with a strong foundation in computer science. The “overall ranking” here is tilted toward the goal of _landing a top tech job or building a startup in Silicon Valley while considering cost-effectiveness_. Waterloo tops because it uniquely balances high outcome with low cost – it’s arguably the best ROI. Berkeley and CMU are powerhouses for tech careers (albeit expensive for an international student). Harvard and Princeton offer arguably the best overall education and networks, which can pay dividends in the long run (especially if you pivot to entrepreneurship or leadership), but their high upfront cost and less direct pipeline to SF drop them slightly in this specific comparison. UBC offers the lowest risk financially and a strong education, but requires more initiative to reach the same Silicon Valley heights, placing it last given the question’s focus.

Ultimately, the “best” choice also depends on personal preference: if one prioritizes **minimal debt and quick integration into the workforce** – Waterloo is king. If one values **prestige and flexibility for future opportunities** – Harvard/Princeton might appeal despite the cost. If one wants **to be in the thick of Silicon Valley as a student** – Berkeley is unmatched. And if one seeks **the most intense CS training** – CMU is ideal. The rankings above reflect a balance of all factors with an eye toward **maximizing California tech career outcomes per dollar spent**.

**Overall Ranking (1=best overall for long-term tech career, ROI, and SF goals):**

1. **University of Waterloo** – _Top ROI, direct SF pipeline via co-op, no debt, strong tech reputation._
2. **UC Berkeley** – _Tech powerhouse, ideal location, huge SV opportunities (but high cost)._
3. **Carnegie Mellon University** – _Elite CS, assured tech career success (high cost, non-SV location)._
4. **Harvard University** – _Prestige and network, opens highest doors (expensive; smaller tech focus)._
5. **Princeton University** – _Academic excellence and strong outcomes (expensive; fewer tech peers)._
6. **University of British Columbia** – _Virtually free and solid education, but less direct path to Silicon Valley._

Each of these universities can lead you to a great career in tech; the differences lie in _how_ you get there and at what cost. By considering the above factors – from finances to culture – you can choose the institution that best aligns with your priorities and comfort. The **priority here was given to long-term ROI, cost, and SF placement**, and the rankings reflect that emphasis.
